### The Silver Heron

The Silver Heron is a silk trading ship sailing under the flag of the [Upper Nephra](UpperNephra) Shipping Company headed by [Cyrus Burton](CyrusBurton). The ship was wrecked sometime in the last year and stranded on the 15th of November on the banks of the [Necropolis](Necropolis). The group discovered that a Giant Hermit Crab had made its home in the ship.

### Navigator's log

[Aiwei](AiweiLuTen) found the Navigator's Log in the wreckage. It reads 

> 15 Februari: The captain has been in trade meetings with [Wensworth McCree](WensworthMcCree) for hours. Afterwards he returned complaining that nothing ever gets done these days. He has ordered us to load existing freight, and for me to plot the course downstream to the Tane. Recent foul weather has likely changed the currents, so I’ll be forced to send out a pilot ship to chart the recent changes. It will be a few days before we can set sail again. The pilot will be annoyed to be dragged away from his wife and hearth in this bleak cold weather.

> 17 Februari: With the most recent repairs done, and the pilot returned with fresh measurements, I will have the information needed to plot the appropriate course. So much to do – I find commanding the ship is thirsty work. A good thing that we’ve loaded up a few barrels of Thornberry Whisky.

> 19 Februari: All freight has been loaded onto the Silver Heron. I’ve set out a course that will have us reach Tane safely in a week, if the weather permits. I’ve given the orders for the vessel to be prepared for departure. I’m glad the pilot offered to stay on as an extra deck hand – Often I consider that we’ve long been understaffed. Reminder to myself to hire more deckhands when we reach Magdalen again.
