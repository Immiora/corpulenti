### Star of the West

Diamond tiara that [Florence Burton](FlorenceBurton) wore at her Coming of Age soiree hosted by her father [Cyrus Burton](CyrusBurton) on November 18th.

We were hired to protect the tiara from [Ghost](Ghost). 

Eventually it became clear the the tiara Florence had, had a paste stone in place of the diamond. Likely put in there a long time ago.
