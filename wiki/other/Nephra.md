### Nephra

(Demi-)Goddess representing the river and all its braids. She is the only god represented as human â€“ a dark skinned woman of extraordinary beauty, but untamed, wild and treacherous. She represents erotic love and passion. She represents fertility and rebirth, as it is only in the periodic flooding and braiding of Nephra that the land of Agana can sustain a culture. She is the daughter of [Vitrion](Vitrion) and [Agana](Agana). Her lover was [Vadohr](Vadohr).

The river, especially the upper part of the river, is braided and flows rapidly over treacherous shingle banks. For the most part, the Upper Nephra is unnavigable, and it is only for the existence of the relatively calm [Tane](Tane), Nephra's daughter, that trade with upper Nephra trading outposts like [Brassmere](Brassmere) and [Greyhayme](Greyhayme) is possible.

Colloquially, someone who is "like the river" is considered wild and exciting, perhaps to their own detriment.

### Representation in the city
The [Court of the River Goddess](CourtoftheRiverGoddess) is an embassy to Nephra in [Magdalen](Magdalen).
