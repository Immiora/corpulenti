### Orana

Goddess of arts, specifically the theatrical arts. She also represents the death-side of the veil her mother [Erena](Erena) guards. Represented as a woman with the head of a frog. According to her, truth can be found in emotion. The midwinter festival dedicated to her is a time when the veils between the world are thin and strong emotion can create connections between the worlds of the living and the worlds of the dead. It is a time for music and theatre, for sadness, and tears of joy. It is a time for remembrance of the dead, and the knowledge that your beloved are close. Her twin sister is [Imiz](Imiz).

Ordained of Orana take care of the deceased in Magdalen and other settlements in the Agana, washing them and bringing them to the [Necropolis](Necropolis), a sacred area set aside for the dead where only the ordained are permitted to go. Except during the Orania festivities at midwinter, of course.


### Representation in the city
The [Twin Churches](TwinChurches) are dedicated to worship of Orana and her sister [Imiz](Imiz). [Rosalie Beaumont](Rosalie Beaumont) is a priestess at the Twin Churches, representing Orana.
