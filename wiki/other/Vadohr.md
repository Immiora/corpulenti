### Vadohr

God of culture, represented as a man with the head of a ram. He is associated with the Tiefling community in [Magdalen](Magdalen). Magdalen and the other city states have existed in uneasy relationship with Vadohr, as the stories recognise his role in the creation of human civilisation, but also the cost and treachery it took. To this day, Magdalians do not like false praise and are suspicious of the motives of any who try to suck up to their betters. Vadohr is unloved, except by the Tieflings who consider him unjustly punished. They belief Vadohr represents the courage to stand up to oppressors and teaches them to use smarts over muscle.

### Representation in the city
The [Dungeon Cathedral](DungeonCathedral) is the main seat of worship for Vitrion. The cathedral is well-outside the city walls, in the ward of Eastmire, because the leaders of the city are not comfortable with large scale Vadohr worship within Magdalen. [Val√©rie Courbier](ValerieCourbier) is the spiritual leader of Vadohr worship in Magdalen.
