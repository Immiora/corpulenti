### Elisabeth Burton

Elisabeth Burton was the wife of [Cyrus Burton](CyrusBurton) and the mother of [Florence Burton](FlorenceBurton). She committed suicide, 17 years ago, and her ghost has haunted the premises of [21 Quay de l'Ombre](QuaydelOmbre) until the group placated the ghost on the 16th of November. Her body was found in the basement of the brownstone.

### The Lady in the River

Many of Elisabeth Burton's paintings feature a dark-skinned woman with a braided tattoo on her breast, who stands in the small river that flows behind the house. The group suspects that this woman is [Lady Rue](Rue).
