### Florence Burton

Daughter of [Cyrus](CyrusBurton) and [Elisabeth Burton](ElisabethBurton). Turned 18 on the night of 18 November, where she wore the [Star of the West](StarOfTheWest) while attending a soir√©e in her honour. The Star of the West turned out to be a forgery.

### For a good cause

Florence Burton was apparently planning to donate a substantial sum of money to the Church of [Vitrion](Vitrion). [Quincy Stuart-Lane](QuincyStuartLane) may have known about this plan.
