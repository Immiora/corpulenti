### Harba Ellicott
Another previous victim of [Magdalen](Magdalen) murders. Found dead on November 10th near the pub [The Wondering Scholar](TheWonderingScholar). No witnesses.
On her dead body were found 2 viles of [Forever](Forever).

We also found a sample of her blood and [Pig men](pigmen)'s blood at the [University Greenhouse #3](UniversityGreenhouse). It is likely that she was killed at the Greenhouse and dragged outside toward the pub.

### Graduation project
Harba was a graduate student of prof. [Magnus Cotton](MagnusCotton). Both worked on botany projects. Her thesis was about the classification of the specimen that late prof. [Pete Bishop](Pete Bishop) had brought back from his expedition to [The Marvain Islands](TheMarvainIslands) 10 years ago. 

There were 12 specimens. They are believed to have hallucinogenic properties. Many uncatalogued. Harba left behind a jounal describing her work. 

When we went to her office in the [University Greenhouse #3](UniversityGreenhouse) we only found 11 specimens on her table. One is missing.

### Relation to drugs
We found from visitors of the Wondering Scholar that Harba dealt [Forever](Forever) - a powerful and popular drug. Forever may be plant-based, which may indicate that Harba had something to do with synthesizing the drug.
