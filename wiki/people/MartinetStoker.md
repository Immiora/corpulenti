### Dr. Martinet Stoker

Dr. Martinet Stoker is a scholar at [Waspa's Institute for Knowledge](WaspasInstitute), an institute that is part of Magdalen College. He is also the chief magistrate for [the Magdalen](theMagdalen). He lives next door to [21 Quay de l'Ombre](QuaydelOmbre), where [Lelouche](LeloucheKairon) first met him.


### Files on Nathalie Beaumont

Dr. Stoker's name appeared on redacted files concerning [Nathalie Beaumont](NathalieBeaumont), the scholar who had been imprisoned 40 years ago for her experiments with animal/humanoid hybrids. Stoker found that the archives at [Waspa's Institute](WaspasInstitute) were missing files and journals on Beaumont. He then used his discretionary powers as a chief magistrate to pull the files from the [City Watch](CityWatch). 

### Aura Vitalis Theory

Dr. Stoker has asked the group whether they could find out how far [Phyneas Vyner](PhyneasVyner) is in his research on [Aura Vitalis](AuraVitalis) theory. In exchange for this information, he is willing to allow the group access to the archives at [Waspa's Institute](WaspasInstitute).
