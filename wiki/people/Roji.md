### Roji

Chameleon tiger likely taken to be a replacement of [Yana](Yana) 

### Origins

From Dr. [Hilbert Hawkwood](HilbertHawkwood), manager of the [Magdalen Zoological Gardens](MagdalenZoologicalGardens), we found out that the zoo used to have 2 rare chameleon tigers: [Yana](Yana) and his mate Roji. Yana went missing 4 years ago, and Roji went missing during a break-in on November 17th at night. 

Chameleon tigers are native to [Naivazi](Naivazi) - a huge forest around [Magdalen](Magdalen).
