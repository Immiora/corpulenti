### Yana

Humanoid creature with characteristics of a tiger: claws, teeth and skin. Former leader of the [pigmen](pigmen). We killed Yana the same night he broke in and murdered prof. [Magnus Cotton](MagnusCotton). 

### Origins

From Dr. [Hilbert Hawkwood](HilbertHawkwood), manager of the [Magdalen Zoological Gardens](MagdalenZoologicalGardens), we found out that the zoo used to have 2 rare chameleon tigers: Yana and his mate [Roji](Roji). Yana went missing 4 years ago, and Roji went missing during a break-in on November 17th at night. 

Chameleon tigers are native to [Naivazi](Naivazi) - a huge forest around [Magdalen](Magdalen).
