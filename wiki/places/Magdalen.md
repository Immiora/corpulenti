### Magdalen

The city where our campaign takes place. We are trying to find [Corpulenti](GiacomoCorpulenti), who we believe has been kidnapped by [Ham](Ham) and his servants - [pigmen](pigmen).


### Founding

Magdalen was founded 196 years ago by refugees from Tresse, a city state further downriver, which had been catastrophically flooded. The refugees found the confluence of the [Tane](Tane)-branch of the river, which had recently formed in the same flood, and suddenly allowed ship access to [Brassmere](Brassmere). [Tane](Tane) allowed the building of an embassy to [Nephra](Nephra) on an island in the confluence, from which the city of Magdalen grew. Access to the mulberry forests of the north allowed the silk trade to boom, providing wealth to Magdalen. However, the citizens of Magdalen know that the city exists on borrowed time, but for the grace of the gods, and [Nephra](Nephra), wild as she is, can flood on a whim.
