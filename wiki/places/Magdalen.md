### Magdalen

The city where our campaign takes place. We are trying to find [Corpulenti](GiacomoCorpulenti), who we believe has been kidnapped by [Ham](Ham) and his servants - [pigmen](pigmen).

### Politics

Magdalen consists of three principalities, the Magdalen, Lord's Lane and Ratwater. Each principality is subdivided in wards, and each principality has its own governor (or Mayor, in the case of Ratwater). Together with the chief magistrates of each principality and some prominent guildsmen, they form the [Magdalen City Council](CityCouncil), which is presided by the Lord Mayor of Magdalen, [Tarsim Uptwaith](TarsimUptwaith). There is no unified procedure to get on the city council, with some positions being hereditary, others granted on the basis of influence in the city, and a few are even elected officials.

#### The Magdalen

Wards in the Magdalen are White Abbey, Port Royal, Templeton, Outer Magdalen and Magdalen College.

#### Lord's Lane

Wards in Lord's Lane are The Lumps, Thence, Citadel Hill and Little Lothlorien.

#### Ratwater

Wards in Ratwater are Duskgate, Dockside, Columnborough and Eastmire.

### Founding

Magdalen was founded 196 years ago by refugees from Tresse, a city state further downriver, which had been catastrophically flooded. The refugees found the confluence of the [Tane](Tane)-branch of the river, which had recently formed in the same flood, and suddenly allowed ship access to [Brassmere](Brassmere). [Tane](Tane) allowed the building of an [embassy](CourtoftheRiverGoddess) to [Nephra](Nephra) on an island in the confluence, from which the city of Magdalen grew. Access to the mulberry forests of the north allowed the silk trade to boom, providing wealth to Magdalen. However, the citizens of Magdalen know that the city exists on borrowed time, but for the grace of the gods, and [Nephra](Nephra), wild as she is, can flood on a whim.
