### Session 1 – It was a dark and stormy night

Two figures meet up in a lonely street in upper Duskward. Pearl LeRoux and Lelouche Kairon, who know each other beforehand, question why they’ve been summoned at this ghastly hour to a little alleyway. They walk past the police cordon and are met with DI Tarquin Hamcrusher, who introduces them to his DS, Irene McCoy, her wife, Dr. Ella McCoy, the medical examiner, and two other consultants: Reina, Hamcrusher’s intern, and Aiwei Lu Ten, who is liaising on behalf of ORSA on matters of the arcane and divine. The others do not know this, but Aiwei is really there to investigate possibilities of police misconduct.

They make careful acquaintance, with Reina happily chatting to the others, and then DI Hamcrusher introduces them to the crime scene. DI Dave Harrelson has been found dead just after 11 pm this night (it is now close to 1 am) by a dwarf called Duthor Blessedbelly, who has been put up in the Caretaker, the pub nearby, under supervision of a couple of constables. 

Lelouche starts to take a closer look at the body. As Dr. McCoy tells, there are severe lacerations. Cause of death was loss of blood consistent with these lacerations, probably caused by something sharp, but of considerable girth, rounded almost. Lelouche also finds some items in Harrelson’s pocket, among which a note that shows something of a floorplan. The group does not recognise the general layout, but they pocket the note without showing it to the police officers. 

Hamcrusher mentions that Harrelson was probably on his way out from the brothel that has its entrance here. The establishment is run by Saria DeVaere, a name that is very familiar to Pearl. She delights in the scandal. The group decides they want to talk to madam DeVaere, although Aiwei has some questions for Hamcrusher first.

She confronts him and asks him about any suspects and whether this is the first case of this kind. He readily admits that this is the third murder in a couple of days commited using a very similar MO. The other two victims were Robart Talmayar, found near the duskgate in Eastmire, and Harba Ellicott, a young scholar found near a pub in the Magdalen College ward.


The group is lead by DS Irene McCoy to Madam Saria DeVaere, an elegant elf woman dressed in loose garments who runs the establishment called Dreams of Satin. She looks up at the group and addresses Pearl. “Ah, Miss LeRoux, a pleasure to see you here. How may I be of service?” The group mentions the murder that has taken place outside, and madam DeVaere nods. “Yes, I let mr Harrelson in around 10.” Looking through the records in her ledger, she adds “She was with Emiko Yatsumi, I will have Gladys here take you up to her if you would like.”

They follow the halfling girl who has been assisting madam DeVaere, who leads them to a small but elegant little room where a timid tiefling girl sits behind a mirror curling her hair. Pearl approaches the girl and introduces herself and gains her trust by complimenting her about her beautiful hair. The girl is put somewhat at ease, although she remains timid. She says that Dave Harrelson was with her for about an hour, between 10 and 11, and that she was Harrelson’s particular favourite: he would always visit her, and has been with her 5 times. “Did you love him,” Lelouche asks. “You do know what kind of establishment this is, don’t you?” is the reply. 

Pearl feels like Emiko is not telling everything, and insists to her that she can speak safely and privately. Emiko’s eyes grow, she looks at the other investigators, but after having been reassured that they are also trustworthy, she opens up: “Please don’t tell madam DeVaere this, but she made me say this. I was not with mr. Harrelson.” “Why did she ask you to tell us this?” “I don’t know, but mr. Harrelson was with madam DeVaere herself.” She confides that it was probably business, as madam DeVaere does not usually have romantic relations with customers in this establishment. She confides in Lelouche that madam DeVaere was kind enough to take her on, even as a tiefling, and not a member of the guilds. 

In the meantime, Aiwei asks her cat to have a look around the establishment. The cat sees madam DeVaere editing out some entries in the ledger, and entering Dave Harrelson’s name, essentially confirming what was already found out.

Aiwei asks her what kind of person madam DeVaere is. Emiko replies by saying how she is a kind woman, who is willing to take on those less fortunate, but that she is very influential. Reina asks around to see if her friend Minnie is working tonight. It turns out she is, and Minnie comes down to say hi. They chat for a bit, also about madam DeVaere, although she doesn’t have much more to add than say that they should be kind and honest with her. Minnie might come and visit the group later on to give a little bit more information about madam DeVaere.

They leave the premises, say goodbye to madam DeVaere (Lelouche invites her to come along for a drink in the Caretaker, but madam DeVaere sniffs and coldly replies that she’d rather not). Then they make their way to the Caretaker, passing a ragged looking gnome with a mangy old dog along the way.

In the caretaker they find the two policemen talking to the barkeep, and a dwarf with a small dog looking impatient. They talk to the dwarf. This is Duthor Blessedbelly. He mentions that he was walking his dog in the neighbourhood and spotted a mysterious looking figure with tusks lurking in the alleyway. When he returned later, he saw a dark shape lying on the ground. He approached it and found it was the dead body of DI Harrelson. Well, he was in a right old state. The group asks him if he often goes for these walks and if someone can vouch for this, but the only witness he mentions is the dog, and he jokingly mentions that they could question the dog. Blessedbelly remains stubborn and the group does not trust him per se, but the account tallies with a rank animal scent spotted earlier by Aiwei’s cat. They let him go and talk among themselves.

The tortle jazz player who had been hanging around in the background comes up to them and asks them for a cigarette. Pearl admits she doesn’t smoke, but Lelouche happily obliges. The tortle introduces himself as Miles Crockford, and he confesses that he has been listening in on the conversation. “I was outside myself for a smoko earlier, heard the scream but didn’t see anything. But you might want to ask the fellow just outside the pub, goes by the name of Lunkwill,” he mentions, “and he’s just the type to pick up all sorts of useful information. You’ll find him stubborn at first, but you just have to find the right incentive.”

With that the group leaves the pub and starts to approach the gnome outside who immediately starts running when he sees them approach. Aiwei sprints after him and pins him down into the mud. “Lemme go I didn’t see nuffink,” he starts, throwing rude protests around how he gets picked up by the filth all the time and is well fed up with it. Pearl asks him who he thinks she is. “I think you’re a bloody posh lady, methinks,” he rattles off. “Well, why don’t you tell us what you saw,” she replies, to which he retorts “Well, why don’t you give me a kiss, posh lady.” Pearl declines, but offers some gold coin instead. “Now we’re speaking the same language,” the gnome says. He mentions that he saw the copper leave the brothel, saying goodbye to the red haired elf lady, then be gored from behind by a squat, beefy figure in the shadows. Afterwards the figure ran off into the side alley. Lunkwill gets a gold coin for his troubles and is released looking considerably happier.

The group goes back to the crime scene, where the body has now been removed. Only DS Irene McCoy is still on site now. They exchange a few words, then have another look through the crime scene. Aiwei spots a boot print in the blood, consistent with a roughshod boot of a relatively small size. In the side-alley Lelouche spots that the grate covering the culvert leading into the sewers has been disturbed recently. He also spots that the mortar between the bricks in the wall is soft enough that one could find enough purchase and climb up. Reina takes him up on the challenge and climbs up, dislodging large amounts of brick dust but easily managing to reach the roof. No traces there, so they try the grate. It comes loose easily as Lelouche pulls it, and Aiwei sends her cat into the narrow crawlspace.

The cat emerges into a larger vaulted canal with walkways to either side, running from left to right. The cat walks upstream until it reaches a pipe dripping a black ooze in which it finds a print. Not a bootprint like above, but something more resembling a wild boar. There the reach of the telepathic connection to Aiwei reaches its limits. The group decides to enter the crawlspace themselves, even Pearl, who hitches up her skirts in anticipation of getting dirty. 

The group walks upstream until they reach the pipe, and Aiwei easily jumps across to where the print is. Hearing the sounds of voices from the pipe, she tries to crawl through the pipe herself, but gets stuck a few feet in. She then sends the cat in. The cat reaches a caved in portion of a service corridor, behind which is a makeshift encampment where three humanoid figures are sitting. They have a squat build and a piglike snout with tusks, and they’re talking in a language that is unknown to Aiwei. They spot the cat, which tries to escape.

The cat looks around and follows the service corridor, leading to a large brickfall where a massive crocodile is lazily eating a piece of dead coyote. There is an archway leading back to the canal, and a rickety spiral staircase leading up. The cat darts back to then canal, getting snapped at by the crocodile but missed, and then easily walks back to the group.

The group decides to risk the passageway with the crocodile. Using Shape Water they make a passage through the sewage channel and cross to the other walkway, then walk up to the mound of collapsed tunnel, prepared to attack the crocodile.

That is where we leave this session.

### Session 2 – Boarderline

The group decides to storm the ancient crocodile and soon all investigators are part of the fray. Especially with Aiwei’s deadly stunning strike the crocodile is powerless, and soon Reina and Lelouche get some firm blows in as well. The crocodile falls within seconds. Reina takes a little of the crocodile hide, inexpertly, to fashion into something fancy later on, but otherwise the group presses on in the direction where they know the pig men to be. 

Lelouche feels sort of bad about killing this crocodile, which had done nothing wrong but be here in the wrong place, but there is no denying its monstrous attitude. And anyway, the group does not have the time to deal with such quandaries now when there is a killer on the loose. The group approaches the rockfall behind which the pig encampment is. They hear the voices of the boar people, alert, although only Reina understands the undercommon they are speaking. It is clear that they are aware that there is something going on. “I think they are on the other side,” one of the boar people exclaims. They continue in hushed voices. 

Reina approaches the pig men encampment, strolling right in, and the pig men are immediately suspicious. She spins a yarn about trying to evade capture, and is persuasive as fuck. The pig men buy into it, and they settle down, somewhat more at ease again. The pig men are roasting some meat and offer Reina a piece, which she gladly accepts. She is also offered some vile liquor. The pig men explain that the ruckus with the police men was their doing. They tell of a figure called Hamm who had left a little note for them who to kill. The note is briefly shown to Reina, who notes that Dave Harrelson is the second name on the list. The pig men explain that the first was kidnapped (Giacomo Corpulenti), but the last on the list is still in the future. Reina doesn’t figure out who this Hamm figure is. 

Reina, desparate to make an exit, explains that she has to take a leak first, so the pig men don’t follow her immediately. The remark is heartily laughed about, but the pig men do indeed wait for their own patrol. It gives Reina enough time to alert the rest of the group about what is going on. They decide to ambush the pig men as they appear. Reina returns to the pig men, and together they appear from behind the rock fall. Immediately they spot poor Lelouche who wanted to hide in the rocks but caused a major rock slide instead. A fight ensues, with Aiwei stunning pig men where they stand, Lelouche putting his double-bladed scimitar to good use and Pearl distracting the remaining pig man by having some sort of large monster appear to enter the sewers. One of the pig men is knocked unconscious, the other two flee, but the group decides to give chase. 

Aiwei is fast and quickly catches up to them. The two remaining pig men decide to make a stand, and a deadly fight ensues. Eventually, one of the pig men is killed, and the other knocked unconscious. Gathering the unconscious bodies, the pig men are tied up and separated so they can be interrogated. 

It appears that the leader is the one pig men who has been killed. Lelouche and Reina interrogate the one who had been knocked unconscious in the initial scuffle, and Aiwei and Pearl take on the second. The first is quite uncooperative, spitting in Lelouche’s face and cursing him in the name of Hamm, calling him a Shafit. Lelouche does manage to catch that Hamm can declare something Shafit or Tapu, and that it means holy, of some sort. Lelouche then knocks the pig man unconscious again.

On the other side of the barrier, Pearl takes a minute to tell a story to the pig man, who is easily charmed by Pearls feminine wiles. He appears much more cooperative, and tells them that he was not part of the team that kidnapped Corpulenti. He also knows that Yana, another name on the list, is a helper of some kind, and that Magnus Cotton can be found at the Colin Marshall institute of Botany.

Lelouche approaches the first pig man again, and asks it a couple of questions, but it remains uncooperative. He then knocks the pig man unconscious against the rocks. In the meantime, the note is found again on the body of the dead pig man. Reina recognises part of the message as thieves cant and tries to interpret it. The thieves cant is primitive and she does not recognise all phrases, but she gets the gist of it. She decides to ask the first pig man about it. Lelouche proceeds to wake the pig man up again, but the pig man remains unconscious. He is dead.

But now they have a bit of a problem, since the only living boar man has been stabbed by Reina. She disguises herself as a boar-figure herself, and they put up a little performance about how the investigators are chased away by the newcomer. Reina sits next to the tied up boar and proceeds to talk in Thieves cant to him. The pig man is frightened as hell when he realises who is talking to him, and explains that there is a planned attack on the sovereign – at least, that is what Reina interprets. 

All that is left is to decide what to do with the pig men, both dead and alive. Pearl simply walks up to the charmed boar and, while looking it in the eye, slits its throat. The group hides the bodies and leaves via the spiral staircase that leads up to an unused manhole cover near the duskgate. It is very early morning where we leave the session. 

### Session 2.5 – Foul mouthed

The party find themselves pretty much exhausted after this night’s happenings. Pearl says goodbye to the party, as she favoured sleeping at her own lodgings, but Reina and Aiwei took Lelouche’s offer to sleep on his sofa, which is close by. They enter the dinky office and before Aiwei can crash on the sofa, she notices that they’re not alone in the office. Lelouche calls out, startling the blonde girl who was lurking in the shadows of Lelouche’s bedroom. It turns out to be Feely (Ophelia) Wickham, a friend of Lelouche’s. She bats some eyelashes at the tiefling and says she was in the neighbourhood anyway and needed a place to stay overnight, so she let herself in. Reina is interested in the girl, suspecting a fellow thief.

By this time Aiwei manages to actually kip for a small while, while Lelouche and Reina talk to Feely and start polishing off the admittedly bad booze in Lelouche’s cupboard. After a while, Aiwei is woken, and while Lelouche rummages around his kitchen to find more drinks, Aiwei starts gently questioning the girl, maybe even coming on to her. She tells that she lives out of town on her papa’s estate, but that she was in town to pick up some items and have a good time, and then found herself needing a place to stay. She didn’t think Lelouche would be gone so late, but after having waited for a long while, she decided to just help herself to Lelouche’s bed. She admits to having a terrible crush on Lelouche. 

Aiwei proposes to play a drinking game based loosely on truth or dare: one person tells two things, one truth and one lie, and the others have to figure out which is which. And then they drink. Feely starts with “I came here because I fancy Lelouche”, and “I came here because I needed a place to hide.” Reina sees through the deception and they both drink, leaving Aiwei somewhat confused. Then Reina goes. She tells a store about how she used to have a pet dove (part of both stories), and that she sent lewd letters to a boy,  with the alternative that she was part of a group that was very good at finding hideouts. Aiwei tells that she was either kidnapped together with someone important, and that she may have punched a man to his death. Feely’s eyes go wild at the suggestion.

Feely then mentions that there was a knocking at the door not long before the party arrived at the office. Lelouche presses her for more information, asking about the pitch of the knocking and whether that corresponded to a low, high or medium knock. After a quick reminder lesson about doorknock-pitches, Feely mentions that it might have been a low knock. Just as she says this, an identical frantic knocking on the door happens. Lelouche lets in a frazzled looking DC Kragdelver.

DC Karen Kragdelver starts explaining that when the party was away for a while, DS Irene McCoy got impatient and followed the party in, but she hasn’t come out since. And while the inspector was called out to another crime scene, Kragdelver admits she was getting desparate for help. She left PC Cosh Arvid at the scene while she went around looking for help. The party is not really into launching a rescue operation, but Kragdelver is pretty desparate herself, saying she will go in by herself if the party doesn’t want to help. This convinces the party. To prep, they ask Kragdelver to go around to the surveyor to see if he has a map of this section of sewers, and they themselves take an hour to rest up a little, or in Reina’s case to go look for some higher quality booze. With a bottle of Glen Morag in her possession, she reconvenes at Lelouche’s place.

Lelouche is adamant that Feely doesn’t come along to the sewers, while she’s terribly excited about the idea. Lelouche plays the gentleman, but Reina and Aiwei are amused by Feely’s whole demeanour. Reina does want to know if Feely can defend herself if necessary, and sets up a little mock duel – she gives Feely a candlestick and asks her to try to hit Aiwei. Poor Feely stumbles and the candlestick crashes into a paperweight on Lelouche’s desk. Still, Feely is allowed to come

After a short while, DC Kragdelver returns with a wad of paper, apologising that the map she got from the surveyor (she was lucky he was awake at all) was probably not up to date anymore. Kragdelver offers to come along as well, but the party doesn’t fancy that, and they gently but firmly lead her out of the office. They make their final preparations and then leave together for the sewers.

Passing PC Cosh Arvid, they enter the sewer system once again, now turning to the downstream branch where Loeki, Aiwei’s familiar, spots a number of footsteps. Following the cat familiar into the dark corridor along the main sewer channel, they soon reach an open cistern where two large streams connect into a lower pool. The narrow stairs leading down are slick with algae, as Lelouche can see, although the others are virtually blind, preferring a more stealthy approach. Hand in hand, they start to descend the staircase, but as soon as Lelouche steps on the staircase, he slips. He just manages to grab hold of a step and is still being held by Feely immediately behind him, but he feels his grasp slip and falls backwards into the pool of raw sewage, accidentally swallowing a mouthful of the foul stuff. Aiwei immediately vaults down to fish poor Lelouche from the black water, and the rest, lighting a lantern after all, climb down using the loose brick and mortar next to the stairs. 

A narrow corridor leads parallel to the main current, as it descends even further. A pool of water is ahead, partially submerging the walkway. Loeki spots that this is due to a natural dam of collapsed rubble ahead. Alarmingly, the water level seems to be rising slowly. The rubble seems to have been recently disturbed, causing the pooling to occur.  The group approaches the dam, Lelouche climbing it, to spot the massive dark chasm immediately behind it. Underneath the damn, on a small ledge sticking out is a figure – it is DS Irene McCoy who is in a bad way. She appears to have broken a few bones and is looking unhealthy. Lelouche lets down a rope, but she is unable to grasp it firmly. Aiwei vaults down to the ledge where she helps tie up the sergeant, and Lelouche tries to hoist her up. They almost manage it, but the dam starts to crumble underneath Lelouche’s feet. To prevent a complete washout, the sergeant is let down again, and together with Aiwei they shelter inside a narrow hole in the cavern wall. 

Just in time, since the dam gives way and a massive wave of water goes over the edge. In order to find a different way out, Aiwei sends her cat to scout ahead into the tunnel they’re hiding in. It opens up to a cavern in which a bunch of kobolds are sleeping. There appear to at least be multiple exits from the cave, and Aiwei decides to take the sergeant along through the tunnel, rather than risk another rope hoisting session. They tiptoe through the kobold lair and find themselves facing a number of ladders and passageways.

Meanwhile, Lelouche, Feely and Reina are topside and look around for different ways into the cavern. It is Lelouche who finds a hidden tunnel entrance underneath a metal plate placed over the walkway. Together with Reina and Feely he crawls into the narrow tunnel and soon reaches a cavern lit up by luminescent mushrooms where a number of kobolds are in the process of tending to the crop. They appear supervised by an armoured kobold. Aiwei sends Loeki up one of the ladders and it appears in the same cavern, spotting Lelouche at the opening of the tunnel above the cavern.

The group decides a distraction is probably wise. Loeki proceeds to a different cavern nearby where it makes a ruckus by disturbing some farming implements. The supervising kobold goes to investigate, and in its absence, Aiwei drags the sergeant up to another ladder. Unfortunately, this ladder does not immediately lead to the rest of the group, but instead opens up to the cavern where the supervisor is now looking around. It is a matter of waiting a little for the supervisor to return before Aiwei and McCoy can take another ladder up. This time the tunnel does join up with the tunnel that Aiwei, Feely and Reina are in, and reunited they return topside.

We leave the session with the investigators reaching the open air again, smelling of shit and being covered in sewage, yet safe, together with the sergeant.

### Session 3 – Forever Young

Definitely smelly, the group decides to go home as soon as possible. Aiwei is not willing to help the sergeant get home, and she and Lelouche leave Reina to bring her to her home. McCoy leads Reina to a neat house on the Bast, where the pair wakes up Ella McCoy, Irene’s wife. Confused and sleepy at first, she soon realises what has transpired and starts fussing over Irene. She is thankful, offers to cook Reina dinner some time, and allows her to use the bathroom. Reina gladly accepts and spends an hour soaking off the debris in what is probably the most luxurious bathroom she has ever been in. There must be advantages to being a doctor, she mentions aloud. After having been thoroughly cleaned, she says goodbye to Ella, who mentions that she is expected for the postmortem later that afternoon.

Pearl wakes up in the early afternoon and proceeds on her own to the station to talk to Inspector Hamcrusher. She is shown in and mentions to Hamcrusher that she has come to collect some paperwork about the previous cases connected to last night’s case. Hamcrusher gets some files out, and starts to explain about those cases. First victim was a Robart Talmayar, a merchant who was found on 8 November, attacked near the Dusk Gate. Officers at the scene did not consider the case to be anything special, perhaps other than the brutal wounds on the body, and it was filed as a robbery gone wrong. Then, mere days later, on 10 November, a botany student called Harba Ellicott was found with similar wounds. Again, officers on the scene of the crime did not consider the case anything special, as these officers belonged to a different precinct, but when both crimes were reported in interdepartmental notices, the similarities in wounds gained some attention. Hamcrusher was brought in on the scene, but unfortunately, due to the lax attention in those previous cases, no viable witnesses were produced. This was different with the murder of DI Harrelson. 

The group reconvenes at Lelouche’s place soon after, and then joins Hamcrusher to attend the postmortem at the watch house in the afternoon. Ella McCoy thanks the investigators once more, then proceeds to explain her findings. All very straightforward, she mentions. Death was caused by blood loss due to considerable lacerations to the torso and thigh, consistent with a stabbing attack. The only really striking thing was that the weapon had considerable girth, its cross section almost circular but with a sharp ridge on one side. Lelouche suggests it might have been a tusk, and McCoy admits that this would be consistent with the attack pattern. She also confirms that the other two victims were killed with a similar, if not identical weapon, and that she suspects that Harba Ellicott was moved after her death.

Aiwei is visibly annoyed by the lack of progress after the postmortem – this was clearly all information they knew. The group studies the case files for a while. Most of the things Hamcrusher mentions are present in the files, but the files also note that Harba Ellicott was found with two vials of a new drug called Forever on her. Aiwei makes the link that both Ellicott and Cotton are botanists, and the presence of the drugs on Ellicott’s body provide a new light in which to see the case. Reina mentions she doesn’t know about any drug called Forever. She has heard of two that are readily available on the floating markets, called Slice and Spike, one of which is a fancy, expensive drug, and the other is nasty, dirty junk. Aiwei suggests that Reina ask her friend Minnie at the Dreams of Satin to see if she knows about any drugs floating about, possibly in connection with the Harrelson case. The group makes a small list of things they intend to investigate: 
* visit student bars to ask about Ellicott in connection with drugs
* visit Talmayar’s widow
* visit the Botany Institute
* ask Minnie at Dreams of Satin.

First stop is the Colin Marshall Institute of Cruel and Unusual Botany, an unassuming brick building on the Magdalen College campus. A scribe is seated behind a desk, and the investigators approach her. They mention that they have some questions to ask concerning the death of Harba Ellicott, but the scribe asks them for some form of identification which allows them to ask such questions. Pearl mentions that her name is LeRoux, which does cause a ripple of recognition in the scribe, but she does not step aside until Lelouche starts behaving in a threatening manner. The scribe, clearly deciding this is above her pay grade, takes the investigators along to an office where Dr. Jean Anderson and Dr. Larry Foreman are working. 

Both scholars are reluctant to talk about the case, since they already underwent questioning by the police earlier and did not feel like there was much more to add. Dr. Anderson does mention that Ellicott was a student in their department, and that she worked with Prof. Cotton on a project where she was meant to catalog old samples left to the department by the late Dr. Pete Bishop. Much more she wasn’t aware of, Dr. Anderson admits. In any case, it is not possible to talk to the professor, as he is away on an expedition. She is evasive about where this expedition is to, and mentions that the professor is often away for longer. After pressing her, she admits that the professor is in one of the greenhouses, a mostly uncharted affair of unknown danger. The professor would know more about the greenhouse itself.

The investigators press on, how it is vital that they talk to the professor. Dr. Anderson turns out to have been quite worried about the professor herself, and decides to lead the investigators to him with help of Dr. Foreman. They start packing bags with expedition materials. This scares off the investigators, who quickly mention that they need to do some preparations before going in what is apparently such a dangerous place. Dr. Anderson does have a chart of the known sections of the greenhouse, which she shares with the investigators.

Pearl asks Dr. Foreman for access to the professor’s office, being her usual charming self. Dr. Foreman, a bit of sweat pearling on his brow, lets her into the office. Actually, he can not find the key, but Reina quickly picks the lock and access is soon available. Together the three enter the office, with Dr. Foreman swooning over Pearl. They do find a project proposal of Harba Ellicott, that mentions the cataloging project. In there is a reference to the Marvain Islands as the origin of the samples that Dr. Pete Bishop brought back.

The investigators take their leave, announcing they will be back early in the morning with their supplies, then proceed to do a little shopping of their own. Pearl and Reina visit a blacksmith to buy armour while Aiwei and Lelouche go in search of potions of healing. Pearl and Reina manage to find some studded leather armour, but the blacksmith is unwilling to sell them a crossbow, even when enthralled by Pearl. He makes it clear that selling a crossbow to Reina would mean his own death, as sale of the crossbows is bound by strict rules and each crossbow is marked with individual serial numbers.

Aiwei and Lelouche walk over to the Wandering Scholar, and order some drinks (Cherry beer and a Thornberry bourbon of the Marvain Islands). Doric, the barkeep directs them to Grievous, a student who is sitting in the bar currently, who might be able to tell them something about Harba Ellicott. Aiwei approaches the students. Grievous, the scrawny git, is not in a mood to be talking to anyone, especially not Aiwei who pulls a whole drunken punter routine. She asks him what he studies (law), and how it compares to something dangerous, like botany. Grievous gets more and more annoyed, until Aiwei and Lelouche offer to buy the students a drink. Then he is willing to tell them that Harba Ellicott did indeed sell some good gear every once in a while, and that she liked her nice things. 

In the meantime, Pearl and Reina visit Dreams of Satin. The doorkeep lets them through to visit Minnie. There is not a lot of activity in the brothel this evening, as the place has been shut down for the night after yesterday’s attack on its front door. Minnie lets them in and is happy to talk to Reina. Minnie tells them that she knows of a newfangled drug called Forever, which is all the rage with the girls nowadays. But she did not see any particular amount in the brothel these days. She reassures Reina that she is fine, and that she willl let Reina know if anything changes. Reina and Pearl rejoin Lelouche and Aiwei at the Wandering Scholar.

Next plan is to visit the floating markets. There we finish this session.

### Session 4 – The Floating Markets

The plan is for the investigators to pose as the bodyguards of Pearl LeRoux, who is looking to buy some designer drugs for an upcoming soirée that she is organising. They caught a rumour that the floating markets were close to the Thence wool markets yesterday, and Reina suspects that they might stick around for a couple more days before moving to a new location. At the wool markets, Aiwei spots a particular alleyway where more people seem to enter than exit from, and upon looking at the alleyway, it leads into an empty cul-de-sac, when just before a number of people entered the alleyway. Reina points out the half-moon sign scratched onto one of the doors. 

The doors open to a small, dark ante-chamber where a half orc behind a hatch asks them for the password. Reina doesn’t know, and suggests Pearl charm him. Pearl mentions that she is miss LeRoux, upon which the half orc says he is the prince of Greywinter. He offers to let them in for 20 gp, a blatantly large price, but Pearl is willing to pay it. The half orc lets them in, warns them not to make any ruckus and keep fighting into the pits. 

They enter the floating goblin markets – the complete inner space of the block has been occupied, with three stories of stalls and stands, selling different exotic items. Aiwei has Loeki scout around, but Pearl soon spots a likely seller. Lelouche, acting all gruff, clears the way and leads the party to the half elf, who is happy to tell them things about different drugs. She offers free samples, and when Pearl mentions she intends to buy a larger amount of Forever for a soirée she is organising, the half elf – while she doesn’t give any names – mentions sotto voce that she should hurry: the supplier hasn’t been seen for a while, and the supplies are dwindling fast. Naming the price in electrum pieces, the party realise that they do not have any of the rare currency, even if they could nominally afford the price. They ask her to keep a little supply on hand for later that night, and the half elf agrees. She winks at Lelouche as the party makes its way to the tavern at the ground floor.

While Loeki keeps an eye on the half elf, the party goes to buy drinks from Louise Midgeley, the barkeep. There are a couple of figures in the bar, three apparently boasting of prior victories, another four hooded, and speaking an unknown language. The party happily chats to Louise, who is happy to tell Aiwei that a bunch of pirates from the Buncy-isles visited the markets about a month ago. She refers Aiwei to Yasane, a tiefling who sells all sorts of trinkets for more information about the pirates. She also mentions the latest gossip: the ghost, an audacious society burglar, has struck again and stole a precious necklace with a large sapphire from Lady DuBois. 

The party decides to have a look around the market, but as they rise, the four hooded figures also get up and approach the party. They turn out to be pig men, and one of them addresses them. “Hamm has gotten wind of your exploits,” he says. “Keep out of the case. Let the bumbling dwarf carry on. As a token of Hamm’s good will, he asked me to give you this,” and with a beautiful, jewel encrusted dagger he cuts a purse loose from his belt and offers it to Lelouche. Lelouche and Pearl immediately retract, and mention that they have no interest in listening to Hamm, and want to stick to the case. Aiwei tries to keep them talking for a small while, but the pig men just gruffly mention ‘you have been warned’. The purse of coins disappears on the leading pig man’s person, and the four retreat back to the corner of the tavern where they came from. Reina offers to pick the pockets of the pig man. Artfully she sticks to the shadow but approaches the figure, and without too much issue she returns with both the purse of money and the beautiful dagger the pig man was using. The purse contains 200 EP, which the party divides among themselves.

Aiwei goes back to Louise Midgeley, the barkeep, and asks her to keep an eye out for the behaviour of pig men or similar thugs. She gives her 2 EP for her troubles, as well as her address at ORSA. She then continues to find Yasane, the tiefling who is selling trinkets. Yasane shows a number of beautifully crafted silver ear pendants with gems embedded in them. She admits that as a follower of Erena, the pendants have little value, but she does have a beautiful onyx inlaid one that could provide someone who pursues justice with something that provides some extra clarity, for 100 EP. Aiwei thanks her for the offer, but refuses politely, whereupon Yasane offers a different one made of jet. It doesn’t provide the clarity, but for only 10 EP it is very pretty. Aiwei offers to give Yasane 5 EP to send a message to the pirates she knows that she has some work for them. Yasane says that she expect to see the pirates within a couple of weeks, at least ahead of the Orania festivities.

Pearl and Lelouche head to Amelia Stokes, the half elven lady selling Forever, who is now selling her wares nearby the hot tubs. Lelouche, who is clearly interested, makes a number of chivalrous and complimenting remarks, and the half elf seems to pick up on it. She offers some extra samples, and heavily flirts back, hinting that the two of them could go for a visit into the hot pools. Pearl breaks in, declaiming how unprofessional she thinks it is that Lelouche is flirting when on duty. She buys a number of Forever doses from Amelia, then quickly draws Lelouche away from the action.

More or less at this moment a demonstration of some sorts occurs. Mr. Hockerby and Mr. West start to draw a crowd announcing their new Bowless mk II. Mr. West, a man in a bowler hat, asks around for volunteers, and of course his eye is drawn by the beautiful Pearl. He suggests she come up. Lelouche steps in and firmly tells West that Pearl is not available for such things. Mr. West takes it up well. “Ah, a volunteer,” he exclaims, and proceeds to give Lelouche a thick wooden disk with concentric circles drawn onto it. He is positioned on one end of the crowd, while Mr. West takes out one of his Bowless mk IIs, a flintlock gun, loads it, and hands it to pearl. He then holds her from behind while leading her hands into aiming for the target in Lelouche’s hands. 

At this point the pig men decide to use the commotion to leave. Aiwei keeps an eye on this, and quickly follows. There is some commotion, and Pearl’s eyes are drawn by the movement of the pig men away from the scene. It causes her to accidentally swerve, as the bullet is fired. Lelouche feels the bullet graze his ears, and it ricochets off a wooden post a storey up. A scream, and Lelouche and Pearl quickly make their exit, following Aiwei.

Aiwei follows the pig men as they make their way through the city, initially going south, then veering south west in the direction of the Columnborough Bridge. She manages to head them off and positions herself on the bridge, hidden in a little nook. When the four pig men appear in front of the bridge, Lelouche and Pearl can see them from the main road, and are also spotted by the pig men simultaneously. Pearl makes a feint, pretending to throw something in the water, while having the illusion of the fancy dagger appear in the water. One of the pig men investigates, the other three quickly follow Lelouche and Pearl as they dive back into an alleyway. They run, skip into another side branch, stumble over a dumpster but hide behind it, Lelouche covered in garbage. Aiwei, meanwhile, sneaks up on the fourth pig man and clocks him. He falls on the floor, stunned, giving Aiwei the opportunity to tie him up and hide him. 

When the three other pig men do not return via this route, Aiwei meets up with Lelouche and Pearl. They decide to reconvene the day after, at the Colin Marshall Institute. Pearl offers to ask one of her friends to deliver a message to Dr. Larry Foreman with a dose of Forever, asking him to analyse the drug. The others think this is a good idea, and as Pearl makes her way back to her father’s house, she asks her friend Sarita Layton to deliver this message. She even offers Dr. Foreman an evening together with her in exchange for this analysis.

When the others have left, Aiwei returns to the hiding spot and recovers the prone body of the pig man. She knocks him unconscious and takes him back to the monastery, into one of the cellars of ORSA. There she files the necessary paperwork to keep him there, and then goes off to rest herself.


In the morning, all four investigators meet at the entrance of the Colin Marshall Institute. It is 14 November, and when the group meets up with the two scholars, Dr. Larry Foreman becomes scarlet upon seeing Pearl. He looks like he has pulled an all-nighter, and can already tell that he suspects the sample to be the drug Forever, or at least something similar. He thinks he will have a more complete analysis complete in half a day (after Pearl presses on), but is unsure whether the sample is synthetic or natural.

Dr. Anderson explains that the greenhouse is mostly the domain of Dr. Pete Bishop, who died some four years ago. After asking further, it appears that Dr. Bishop actually died in this particular greenhouse, and that his body was never recovered. Pearl suggests that Dr. Bishop is therefore technically just missing, and could still be alive. Dr. Anderson disagrees: when you work in this particular field of botany, you would know that he really is dead. She mentions that Cotton went in here, but is not sure where Cotton would be. She also knows that the greenhouse is partially submerged, but that a little boat is usually present in the Pottery workshop. Of course, it is possible that Cotton took this boat, but apparently another could be present in the Hall of Mandrake, even if she doesn’t know where that hall is.

The door to the greenhouse is opened, blowing a draught of hot, humid air into the faces of all the investigators. The large metal door leads to a dark corridor that quickly splits in two. Taking the left branch, the group walks past nooks in the rocky walls, that are covered with glass sheets. Inside, some scuttling motion can be observed. Further in, some of these terraria have the glass fractured, and there is no movement present in the niches. Shards of glass are strewn across the floor here. After a while, the two branches of path reconvene at a set of doors. A narrow split between the doors lets in light and a draught, which smells sweet, fragrant and almost sickly. The map names this room the Nepenthes dome, and Dr. Anderson knows that Nepenthes is a family of pitcher plants, usually insect-eating, although she has seen larger specimens that could eat whole mice.

Aiwei sends in Loeki the cat – the doors lead to a bright glass dome filled with plants. A narrow track leads to the right, while prominently in the middle is a small pavilion from which giant scarlet flowers are suspended. A small waterfall comes clattering down, and flows away through a series of narrow channels. The group enters the dome, and as they come closer to the pavilion, the scent increases, becomes fresher and more appealing. And Lelouche, Aiwei and Pearl all suddenly find themselves inexplicably drawn towards the origin of the scent, and start to approach the chalice-like flowers in the middle of the dome.

### Session 4.5 – Wake

At the floating markets, Reina looks around to see if she can spot Skinny Joe, a friend of hers who usually skulks around places like this. He does indeed appear to be around, possibly picking some pockets of visitors to the markets. She draws his attention and gestures to meet him in the makeshift tavern downstairs. After some ten minutes he joins her in a secluded nook of the tavern. Reina gets some beers and asks around. They talk about Reina’s current employment at the city watch. Joe is happily chatting about his latest exploits when Reina asks him whether he has heard the name Yana. A shadow seems to cross his face, and he immediately becomes serious. “Keep out of things if Yana is involved,” he says. “It is a dark name that sometimes is heard in connection with terrible events. Has been going around for maybe a year and a half or so? Not even sure if it is a person or what. Maybe it’s an organisation? Please Reina, be careful about these things.” Reina reassures him, tosses him some coin and urges him to give something back to his latest victim.

During her conversation with Skinny Joe, the pig men left the premises during some commotion at the demonstration booth. Reina’s friends went after them, leaving Reina alone on the markets. Reina uses the opportunity to go around looking for more possible intel. She does not spot any more pig men in the markets, but she does spot a Mazear Caskheart, a dwarf she has done some business with in the past. In Thieves’ cant, the dwarf recruits her for a job to gather intel for the gamblers and bookies’ organisation Mazear works for. They have heard rumours of an assassination planned on the sovereign, but want to know who is behind it and what is planned. Reina is somewhat confused: Magdalen does not have a king or sovereign, and the current Lord Mayor, Tarsim Uptwaith, is not usually referred to as the sovereign. She does accept the job, negotiating a CR7 fee.

Reina retreats to the tavern, striking up a conversation with Louise Midgeley, the barkeep. She asks Midgeley what she thinks of the current Lord Mayor. Midgeley replies noncommittally, but does remark that he’s been sending troops into Eastmire, what with all those riots there of the Tieflings. Reina remarks she didn’t know about the riots. “Well,” Midgeley continues, “your friend’s lot, they’ve been protesting some law recently, coming to fists with the golden brand recently. Seem to want to be congregating within the city walls, which is what the law forbids. Don’t know why them Tieflings would want to be congregating though.” “Well, we’re congregating now,” Reina pipes in. “Oh, maybe so, but I still don’t like them much. Just looking into those empty eyes gives one a feeling of chill down the spine.”

Reina leaves the floating markets and decides to have a quick look at what’s been going on in Eastmire. She disguises herself as an average, brownish Tiefling, hooded, and makes her way to Eastmire. The ward, part of the Ratwater principality, looks a lot more ramshackle, wooden temporary buildings that have now been standing here for decades, taking on a more permanent nature. There are quite a few people on the streets, mostly Tieflings, some of them standing around fires lit in barrels or braziers on the streets. Reina reaches the Eastmire Market Square, close to the Dungeon Cathedral, where worshippers of Vadohr convene. The market is filled with people, groups of Tieflings. On the edges of the squares, sitting on horseback, are soldiers, golden cloaks visibly marking them as members of the Golden Brand. Closer to the dungeon cathedral, Reina hears the singing. Unearthly chanting in a language Reina does not understand, all coming together in a common song. Close to the Dungeon Cathedral, Reina spots that people tend to go into the church, and others coming out again. Reina joins a group entering the cathedral. The group acknowledges her presence. The Dungeon Cathedral is a low ceilinged wide space dotted with columns, but quickly the floor drops into a half-circular deep theatre. At the bottom, surrounded by a fence is an altar on which a black box is placed. Together with the general air of deep, deep sadness, Reina suddenly realises that this is a wake. A funeral. 

A woman in priestly garb, a white gown decorated in green leafs, addresses each visitor briefly, some making polite conversation, others just acknowledging. Reina, when it’s her turn, politely expresses her condoleances, and admits she did not grow up in a community where the Tiefling language (infernal) is spoken. The priest thanks her for the words and advices her to be like the person who died: stand up for your believes and your culture, even if, like the dead person, you are not important or influential in the usual metrics. 

When Reina reappears outside, the square is even busier. She strikes up a conversation with a dark red Tiefling standing around a fire. She introduces herself as Dairon, his name is Cédric. He points out wat he thinks will happen here tonight. Golden brands are standing on all exits of the square, some on the roofs of buildings. A fight will likely break out, a scuffle at first, which the Golden Brands will use as a provocation. “You are young,” he says. “Young on the outside only,” says Reina. “Still, you should leave this square,” he continues. “We need young people. I would not judge you if you left.” Reina acknowledges, says she owes him a drink, and leaves the square. 

As she passes the Golden Brand soldiers, they look at her with a foul look, but let her pass. Reina leaves Oatmeal, her owl, flying overhead to keep an eye on what happens. The evening unfolds with only a minor scuffle, this night at least. A shouting match starts to turn into an exchange of fists, upon which the Golden Brands make a charge across the square, dispersing the crowds into the narrow alleyways of Eastmire. The stragglers are arrested, and the unnatural quiet returns.


Reina tries to sleep, but finds herself feeling anxious. Then she finds herself on a broad beach, her room and the rest of the city vanished. She walks around the seafront, waves flowing over her feet. Something is in the water, just ahead. It is a piece of driftwood, covered in barnacles. She walks on, the fog drifting in until the fog is so dense she feels like she can touch it. She does touch it, and it is her pillow, and Reina is awake again, back in her room.

### Session 5 – Green Underneath Domes of Glass

As Aiwei, Lelouche and Pearl slowly start ambling towards the scarlet chalice-like flowers of the pitcher plant, Reina is surprised by their reactions. She tries to shake Aiwei awake, but she does not respond. Loeki has a better approach – its razor-sharp claws snap Aiwei out of her thrall, and she realises what was about to happen. Pearl is less lucky: she approaches the pitcher and is engulfed by the thorny vines of the pitcher plant, acids flushing the chalice and slowly starting to digest her as she stares bemused by what is happening to her. The damage it causes, does allow her to wake up from her thrall and she now starts struggling. Lelouche, even though he himself is still charmed, sees his friend in need and races to her aid. Soon she is released from the vines. 

Aiwei, from the moment she escapes the plant’s charm, starts pounding on it with heavy punches, doing severe damage to the plant. She is aided by the two scholars, who get a few blows in. Reina herself puts her new dagger to good use, and soon the luring pitcher starts lashing out violently in a desperate attempt to ward off the attack from its prior victims. Aiwei finds the proper weak spot, and under the weight of the massive flowers, the entire mass of the plant body is ripped open, leaving a dull, browning mess behind. 

“Larry, I’m very disappointed,” says Pearl, who is now covered in sweet, sticky liquid. “In the end, Lelouche had to rescue me from the pitcher.” The scholar becomes somewhat defensive, but as Pearl insists, his resistance visually melts away. The group decides to look around the glass dome. Other plants have similar chalices like the luring pitcher, but far smaller and not threatening to the group. Reina realises that there is a draught coming from between some vines. Brushing them aside, she finds a hidden corridor that was unmarked on their map. 

Following the corridor, the group enters a smaller dome, full of tropical plants and a fresher scent than in the heady Nepenthes dome. Aiwei urges Dr. Foreman to look around for familiar plants, and he quickly starts calling out specific features that he does recognise, specifically a bush that has some wholesome berries that help with healing and sustenance. The group also spots two fractured panes of glass in the dome, at the point where the glass portion of the dome connects to the solid walls. Aiwei quickly climbs up to see – the gap now allows access to the outside world, and Aiwei spots the river immediately next to the dome. Glass fragments suggest that medium-sized creatures may have used the panes as an access and departure point, but it is hard to see whether this is recent.

They go back to the Nepenthes dome and, with Larry and Lelouche in the lead (Pearl insists that Dr. Foreman goes in front), they follow the corridor to the east. Lelouche remarks upon the presence of footsteps. One set is Halfling sized, the other far larger and irregular. The tracks seem independent, and since the scholars mention that both Harba and the professor are halflings, it is just the larger, irregular tracks that worry the investigators. 

They enter the next dome, marked Fountain of Youth on their maps. The dome is somewhat smaller, with trees and bushes lining the space surrounding a marble bassin with a statue in in depicting a nude female form with a cat-shaped head. The investigators recognise it as an avatar of Imiz, the cat-goddess of knowledge. The bassin is filled with algae-stained water, but no water flow is present. Aiwei tries to clean out the vase that the figure carries, but even though a lot of gunk comes out, the fountain does not flow. 

Carefully, the group decides to continue, and soon they come to a crossing of corridors. The larger, irregular tracks seem to go mostly straight and to the right, while the Halfling-sized tracks go to the left. As the group discusses which way to go, Aiwei notices something moving in the corner of her eye. Something big! As she turns around immediately, nothing appears out of the ordinary, back in the direction where they came from. Lelouche volunteers to go looking once more in the dome, but he finds nothing. Aiwei decides to leave Loeki around, just to see what happened. Lelouche and Pearl suggest to take the track towards the pottery workshop, following the Halfling-sized footsteps. After all, they are in there to find the professor, not to deal with any large and unusual creatures here. Asking the scholars if they know of any large creatures that live inside the greenhouse, Jean Anderson replies negative. “There is a butterfly garden somewhere, and a Hall of Mandrake, but I have no idea where those places might be.”

Arriving in the pottery workshop, the group sees a mess – upturned tables and bags of fertiliser spread over the place. The group recognises it as signs of a struggle. Continuing, Dr. Foreman finds that the corridor ahead of them is submerged in water. Pearl asks him if he would not be the gentleman and carry her across. Dr. Foreman protests a little: “Ms. Pearl, I would be happy to carry you, but I’m afraid the water goes very deep and I would not be able to keep you dry.” “I’m sure you find a way,” Pearl presses. Aiwei and Reina have an idea: they both are able to locally freeze water, making sure they can stay above the surface. Together, they start freezing local patches of water so that the group can proceed, and quickly they get to the late Dr. Bishop’s study. 

There, the investigators find further evidence of a struggle, although the marks here are more subtle. Furthermore, they find Harba Ellicott’s workplace, a desk where a number of samples is placed, together with two journals. While Aiwei keeps a lookout, Lelouche and Pearl leaf through the journals. One is an older work, the original notes of Dr. Bishop detailing his different dealings on the Marvain Islands. The other is Harba Ellicott’s journal, promising a systematic and modern taxonomical approach for the samples Dr. Bishop left behind. The group takes both journals, but leave the samples. One thing does strike them as odd: only eleven samples are present on the desk, while the journal mentions twelve. The room has plenty more shelves of old samples in dusty jars, but none other with that same recently cleaned and looked at look that the eleven samples on the desk have.

Heading back into the corridor, they soon come to another crossing of corridors. Suspecting that the south branch leads further into the main greenhouse, they decide to take the east corridor to get that side out of the way first. Freezing the water ahead of them, they get to a submerged gate and finally to another large glass dome, sunk even further into the ground and completely submerged. They skirt the outsides and take one of the gates leading out of the gate, as they do not trust the water in this dome. It leads to another submerged room with a beautiful submarine reef and aquatic life, followed by a small beach inside another, smaller dome, where they find an odd sight: a mahogany writing desk on the sandy beach, and the body of a Halfling lying underneath a tree. 

The Halfling turns out to be Professor Cotton, and he appears to be sleeping. He wakes up wide eyed, looking at the people who interrupted his nap. “Well, explain yourself, what are you doing here?” Pearl approaches. “We are here for your protection. Have you heard about the murder of Harba Ellicott, your student?” The professor is flabbergasted. “What?! Harba dead? How did that happen?” The investigators explain that she was found dead a couple of days ago, but that they suspect the perpetrators to also attack the professor. 

The group ask the professor about his knowledge of the drug Forever, and if he knew that his student was selling it. The professor seems genuinely surprised by this knowledge, and exclaims how he can not believe that Harba Ellicott would do such a thing. “I mean, she was given a stipend,” he protests. Aiwei does remark that Dr. Foreman looks somewhat uncomfortable during the discussion.

They convince the professor to come along – in any case he had lost track of time and realised he was due back for a while. As he collapses the mahogany desk to a small suitcase, and packs up his papers, the group proceeds to move back. The professor has a small boat at the beach, which just about fits all the group members. Carefully they start to paddle back towards the dome and the office.

In the meantime, Loeki has stood guard at the fountain of youth dome. Suddenly, four trees uproot themselves and start walking in the direction of the crossroads. Loeki follows. The trees hang about the corridor for a while, then two decide to continue down the eastern corridor, while the other two remain in place at the crossroads. Aiwei, alerted to this by Loeki, looks along, and hints to the others that they might be in for a surprise later on. 

Back in the pottery workshop, the group finds more traces of the fight, including a lot of blood that seems to have been partially adsorbed into a bag of fertiliser. Pearl opens the bag, in order to see whether anything unexpected is inside, but the bag just contains a lot of blood-stained fertiliser, falling out and covering her with the stuff. 

Making their way back to the crossroads, the others now also see the two new trees here. Aiwei suggests to talk to the trees, hopefully they have seen something of what happened inside the greenhouse. Pearl urges the professor to talk up, expecting his expertise in botany to yield a specific method. The professor just goes “Hello, trees!” There is no immediate reply, although after a couple of minutes of reflection, one of the trees appears to come to life. Bending over towards Lelouche, a massive, grotesk wooden semblance of a face is part of the bark, and a wide crack opens as a sort of mouth. In common, it asks “What are you doing in my home?” Lelouche apologetically explains that they are just passing through, trying to find the professor. The tree is not amused. “What should we do with you? What do you think, Bitterbeard?” The other tree replies. “I am not sure. They should keep out.” The investigators convince the two trees to tell them about who was here before, and promise to leave the greenhouse immediately afterwards. Bitterbeard tells them that a couple of animal-like abominations entered the greenhouse some days ago, and confirms that some of them were pig-like, although there were also dog-like humanoids. He tells that the creatures are grotesk mimics of humanoid, bent and twisted into this shape. 

Quickly, the group leaves the greenhouse with the three scholars. Professor Cotton is appalled at the damage done to the Luring Pitcher, explaining that simply passing it with one’s nose closed would have protected them from its influence. “It’s an invaluable specimen!” In any case, soon the heavy metal door is closed and locked.

Aiwei and Lelouche take a moment to discuss among themselves. “Do you trust the professor when he says he did not know about the drugs?” Lelouche asks. “I think he was truthful,” says Aiwei. “But we should keep an eye on Dr. Foreman, he seems to know more.”

The group discusses what they have found out. A question they still have is which of the twelve samples is missing. Realising that the eleven jars are still inside Dr. Bishop’s study, they can not compare the samples to the samples described in Harba Ellicott’s journal, until Aiwei realises that Loeki is still present inside the greenhouse, left behind. Looking through Loeki’s eyes, Aiwei is able to compare the samples present with those described in the journal, until there are three options left. Specimens 4, 9 and 11 (handouts provided) resemble two samples that are present, and the third most likely is fairly similar in appearance.

The group decides that the best way to proceed is to pretend the professor is still inside the greenhouse. Reina and Pearl guard him inside his office, accompanied by Dr. Foreman, while Lelouche and Aiwei stake out the potential entry point in the greenhouse from the outside. The two leave the institute and walk on its outside perimeter until they get to the point they recognise as the smaller dome with the fractured windowpane. The evening is falling, and they start their stakeout.

We end the session here, and all investigators reach level 6.

### Session 6 – Imposter Syndrome

The investigators decide to stake out, but in order to keep in touch, Reina decides to keep her familiar Oatmeal with Lelouche and Aiwei. While she is not able to keep in direct touch with it, she can look through its eyes every once in a while. Aiwei and Lelouche find a spot in a shrubbery close to the fractured windows of the glass dome. Lelouche’s horns stick out slightly from the plants, but Aiwei spots it luckily enough, and pushes his head down slightly. They await for a small while, yet nothing happens. Cramped as their position is, they decide to leave Loeki at the site to spy for Aiwei, while she and Lelouche retreat to around the corner. 

Inside the institute, Pearl urges Dr. Foreman to continue his analysis of the drug. He prepares a TLC experiment to extract the different components of the drug. Meanwhile, Reina interrogates the professor about the origin of the samples they saw at Dr. Bishop’s office. The professor tells her that the samples were old, the expedition to the Marvain Islands was about a decade ago. Dr. Bishop died four years ago, and the samples have been collecting dust ever since. 

Dr. Foreman, after about an hour, announces to Pearl that he found something interesting: the drug seems to consist mostly of regular alcohol. There is only a minor component of something else, which he has not identified yet. Pearl urges him to identify this other component. He explains that this may be hard. “Imagine you’re in a theatre, and you point out someone in the crowd, and ask me whether this is my brother Fred, then I just take a look at him and I’ll be able to tell whether this is my brother or not. But if your question is “Who is this person?” then you’re asking a very difficult question.” Pearl doesn’t seem to understand the analogy, and leaves the office to join Reina and the professor.

The professor announces that he’s hungry. Reina calls for Rose, the scribe. She promptly joins the group in the professor’s office. He passes a small purse of coin over to Rose, and asks her to go out to buy something to eat for himself and the investigators. Rose leaves. Pearl explains to the professor that she probably is not going to eat anything here, as she only tends to eat food prepared at her home. After all, someone could have poisoned the food.

Outside, Lelouche and Aiwei fill the time by talking about their personal lives. “So, what’s all this about Feely, eh?” Aiwei asks. “Well, I’ve known her since she was a small child, growing up on the neighbouring estate. Now she courts danger and excitement. And yes, I’m not blind, I can see she’s a very attractive young lady, but she’s like half my age.” “So, how come you do not live at your family’s estate anymore?” “Well,” answers Lelouche, “we have a fundamental difference in values. My parents like killing for sport. I disagreed. And then I did something they could never forgive. My family likes to beat the servants, and at some point I couldn’t stomach it. I said something to father.” He proceeds to explain that the stable boy had been beaten to within an inch of his life, and Lelouche stepped in. He soon left the family, and they have not been in touch since, even with his younger siblings whom he did rather like. “My mother tells me that I’m dead to her.” “A consolation then, ” says Aiwei, “that there is a higher justice in this world.” They reminisce about their meeting at a fighting ring. “So how did you end up at the monastery at your age?” Lelouche pressed. Aiwei replies: “I’d fallen out with a former employer, and felt people looking down on me. I wished to find a place where I could be more myself.”

They hear the sound of oars splashing in the otherwise clear river. A small skiff is passing, ferried by a masked individual. One of the ordained of Orana ferrying one of the recently deceased to the Necropolis, it appears. Aiwei has Loeki follow the skiff for a small while, but the skiff just passes without taking note.

Rose returns to the institute, and together with Dr. Foreman and the professor, Pearl and Reina have their evening meal. Pearl asks Foreman to taste her food for him, in case someone did poison the food. He gladly obliges, all his resistances having melted. Reina does like this idea, and offers to pre-taste the food for the professor. Without waiting for his agreement, she scoffs down half of his food, leaving only a little for the poor professor. Outside, Dr. Anderson passes Lelouche and Aiwei to bring them something to eat too, after which she leaves for her office again.

In shifts, the groups keep watch over the professor and the entry into the glass dome. The first watch passes peacefully, after which Aiwei wakes Lelouche and Reina wakes Pearl. Lelouche, tired after several longer days, finds himself nodding off until he falls asleep outright.

It is around 3 in the morning when a scream sounds from outside. Lelouche sleeps through it, but Aiwei is awoken by the disturbance. Reina, inside, shakes Pearl awake, and they look outside the chamber. Rose Tanner approaches, in her nighties and her tight bun released. “Something outside woke me!” she exclaims. Pearl and Reina lock the professor, Dr. Foreman (who had fallen asleep on his analysis) and Rose Tanner into the professor’s office and tell them they should open the door to no-one. They also mention a password, then they quickly make their way to the front of the building.

Meanwhile, Aiwei has woken Lelouche, and together they sprint towards the front of the building, where the sound originated. Nothing seems visible here. They bump into Pearl and Reina, who have passed the public Library of the institute which was also deserted now. Backing into the library, Lelouche and Aiwei make a quick search. Lelouche spots a small shiny strip underneath one of the cupboard doors. Upon closer investigation, it is blood that is slowly forming a puddle underneath the doorframe. Lelouche forces the door open, and out falls the body of Rose Tanner, throat slit.

Immediately they register this as something that is wrong: they left Rose Tanner lockup up inside the professor’s office, so she could not have made it here in this time. The Rose Tanner inside the office must be an imposter. Reina looks through Oatmeal’s – who had been left locked up with the professor – eyes and sees the imposter Rose Tanner approach the professor with a jewelled dagger and attempt to slit his throat.

The group sprints back to the office, Aiwei crashing through the door and starting to pummel on the shape of the imposter. It seems to harm the imposter less than Aiwei would expect. Pearl stumbles in but can not contribute much with the professor held by the imposter at knifepoint. Reina throws her magical dagger, which hits the imposter in the neck, doing a critical amount of damage. Lelouche quickly grabs the imposter and shoves her out of the way of the professor, but the imposter wrestles away from his grip, approaches the professor and slits his throat. Professor Cotton collapses as the imposter thrusts their dagger into his belly. Cotton is dead, and Dr. Foreman’s healing spell can not affect him anymore.

As in slow motion, Aiwei starts to pummel on the imposter and manages to stun him. It allows Reina to deliver the killing blow with her dagger, slicing open its throat and cheeks. The figure of Rose Tanner slumps to the ground, then starts to shimmer and fade. The figure of the imposter grows hairier, black, white and orange, until the shape of a massive, humanoid tiger is left. 

Aiwei knocks Dr. Foreman unconscious, and asks loudly: “Where is Dr. Anderson? We’ve been betrayed!” They take the time to look at the body of the tiger. They find a dagger, similar to the one Reina had taken from the pig men earlier. Furthermore, there is a purse with coin, containing a massive 61 pp, 550 gp and 200 ep. There is also a small, ornamental bone carved likeness of Vitrion, the wounded Jackal. Finally, they find a written letter addressed to Lord Yana:

> Lord Yana,
> Meet me on the steps of the cathedral at noon
> -H

The investigators keep the letter as a handwriting sample. As Aiwei goes looking for Dr. Anderson, Pearl revives Dr. Foreman. He looks around what has gone on, and starts to cry. Pearl comforts him somewhat, and asks him if he is able to create a test that can detect the presence of Forever. The sopping doctor agrees and retreats to his office. 

The group discusses about whether they intend to inform the police. Reina mentions she would rather not explain what went down here, so the group decides not to alert the police. Reina then tells that she heard a little more about Yana from Skinny Joe, a friend of hers who she met at the Floating Markets. He mentioned Yana may not have been a person, but more an organisation of sorts, and that it was a very dangerous entity, active for about 18 months. 

The group then decides to reconvene close to noon at the steps of the Wooden Cathedral, dedicated to Vitrion, in the hopes of figuring out the next clue. And there we close the session.

### Session 7 – Dead Ends

The session starts in the morning of the 15th of November. All four investigators have retreated themselves to their own homes to catch a few hours of sleep before meeting again a half an hour in advance of noon, when H and Lord Yana are supposed to meet.

When Pearl gets home, a letter awaits her. The letter, printed above, asks her to talk to mr. Granville Rowle, a solicitor, to obtain details about a party for which she is invited, as well as a personal commission. She makes her way to the offices of Batchelor, Bellefontaine and Rowle Solicitors and after a short wait, she is allowed to see the old solicitor. Rowle is an ancient, morbidly obese and wheelchair bound man, but otherwise he is quite lively. He explains to her that it is Mr. Cyrus Burton’s intention to present his daughter Florence, who is turning 18, to society, and he wants her to wear the priceless jewel the “Star of the West”. It is a massive diamond, set in a mithril tiara. He explains that, as a Lady Detective, miss Pearl LeRoux would be in an excellent position to guard the diamond, not unnecessary, since the audacious jewel thief known as “The Ghost” is active.

Pearl asks whether her associates are allowed to come, which they are. Rowle promises to ask Burton to invite Pearl’s associates as guests outright, and offers all a lift in his carriage when he departs for the soirée on the morning of the 18th. Pearl asks him what remuneration Burton had in mind. Rowle provides her with the key of a city brownstone, explaining that, while the property remains with Burton, Pearl and her associates would have free use of the place for the foreseeable future. Pearl accepts the commission, and then proceeds to her rendezvous with the others.

She meets the others excitedly, and tells them quietly about the commission, although not in much detail, as the four are out in the open on cathedral square. Focusing on the task at hand, Reina and Pearl hide in a nook nearby The Scales, the merchant’s guild. Aiwei hides herself on the steps of the wooden cathedral, while Lelouche takes place on the promenade of the Temple of Joy. The time approaches noon, and passes it, without a meeting taking place.

Loeki enters the wooden cathedral as the others wait. Nobody appears to be waiting specifically, although Loeki does spot a young priest praying over the central altar in the cathedral. There are a few people about, although the most recent mass has finished a while ago, and only stragglers and tourists are present. Lelouche enters the temple of joy, hoping to spot any fidgety people. While some people may be fidgety, Lelouche gathers they are just nervous for their upcoming confession, and doesn’t take too much interest in them. 

Frustrated at the fact that they missed the meeting, Aiwei talks to some of the nearby urchins. She promises them some copper in exchange for information about a meeting taking place recently between interesting people on the steps of the cathedral. The two boys run away with their coin.

After about half an hour, the group gives up any hope of catching a meeting here. They retreat to the brownstone Pearl just received the key off. The manor itself is located on 21 Quay de l’Ombre, and it is a handsome brownstone townhouse, narrow but tall, with a garden adjacent to the Rue. There, Pearl explains about the commission she has received from Cyrus Burton. The others are excited! Pearl does mention that the others will need fancy clothes. Lelouche is excited to be wearing his fancy garb again, but Reina and especially Aiwei are not convinced. Pearl offers that one of her ladies would prepare something for the other ladies. She knows that the group cannot show up without some silk in their attire.

Lelouche exclaims that they need to prepare. They need to figure out where the diamond currently is, how it is being transported and when it is given to Florence. They also need to know how the diamond will likely be replaced. Will it be a big party or a small intimate affair? Aiwei suggests visiting Lady DuBois, as she is, according to the rumours, a recent victim of the Ghost. A plan is shaped, where Lelouche and Pearl go talk to Lady DuBois, while Aiwei and Reina pursue a different line of enquiry: they will talk to the widow of Robert Talmayar, the first victim in the Hamm case. Meanwhile, they will pass a contact of Reina, whom they will ask about any knowledge concerning “The Ghost”.

The group passes by Pearl’s place, where Pearl talks to one of her maids, Linda. The maid is happy to prepare some dresses for the two ladies, but insists on taking their measurements. “After all, you do not have quite the same shape, miss,” says Linda. Pearl gets upset. “That was incredibly rude, apologise this instant.” The maid apologises profusely as she takes the measurements of the girls, then retreats. Pearl asks aloud: “Was she implying that I am fat?” Lelouche answers diplomatically: “I think she was implying that you ladies have different shapes.”

On their way, Reina drops a coded message to Dina, her friend, asking the question: “Have you heard about The Ghost? Area of activity? Method of operation?” Reina explains that when they come back in a while, and there are flowers in the windowsill, an open window means that she knows something about it and a reply is placed underneath the flowers. Meanwhile, when the window is closed, she admits to having no knowledge about this person. They leave Dina’s place and proceed to the “Catch of the Day”, the fishmongers in lower Columnborough where Robart Talmayar used to work.

Approaching the house of lady Alida DuBois, Lelouche and Pearl are stopped by a footman, who tells them they need an appointment to see Lady DuBois, as she is not in at the moment. Pearl and Lelouche both suspect that Lady DuBois is at home, but they politely offer to see her solicitor to make an appointment. Coincidentally, her solicitor turns out to be Granville Rowle. As such, the two make their way back to the offices of Batchelor, Bellefontaine and Rowle Solicitors and ask to see Granville Rowle again. After a 10 minute wait, they are seen in. Rowle is in a good mood, and offers them both a drink. He admits to being the solicitor of pretty much most of the Magdalen, and that he indeed thinks that Lady DuBois is at home. “But in any case it is polite to make an appointment, and I see that she has some time available tomorrow at 16.”

Meanwhile, Reina and Aiwei arrive at the fishmongers. There they talk to Greta, the widow, who is holding up a crying baby as she tries to run the shop. She, however, doesn’t know anything about the circumstances surrounding her husband’s death. She admits Robart sometimes was fond of a drop of ale, which he would have at the Twelfth Column, the local tavern.

When pressed, Rowle provides Lelouche and Pearl with the guest list for the upcoming Soirée. Apart from himself and the hosts, Lady DuBois and her daughter are there, as well as the commander of the Golden Brand, the standing army, and a priest of Vitrion. Furthermore, two eligible bachelors will be present, one of which is the younger brother of Lelouche. Finally, Ophelia Wickham is invited.

Reina and Aiwei inspect the Twelfth Column, a tavern ran by an elf. Aiwei does remark upon the suspiciously large number of elves in the tavern (she makes acquaintance with a Jasna, who is playing cards), but the innkeeper tells them that since he is an elf, his kin tend to feel welcome there. Plus, the place is not so very far from Little Lothlorien. He also mentions that he knew Robart Talmayar, as he was their neighbour. Otherwise, the innkeeper can provide little information, and Aiwei and Reina decide to turn back to the others.

On their way back to the university, where the group has agreed to meet up, Reina picks up a message from Dina, saying “More information forthcoming. The Ghost is an audacious burglar. Steals at night after a fancy party.”

The group rejoins again, then proceed to the Colin Marshall Institute. The entrance has been cordoned off and two black cloaked figures guard the entrance. Pearl approaches the entrance and gets the guards to collect Phineas Vyner, a warlock of the Black Academy who has taken charge of the investigation there. He mentions that all the faculty are either dead or missing (Dr. Anderson and Dr. Foreman both are missing), and questions Pearl whether she knows anything about this. Pearl denies, and returns to the others.

Secretly, the group tries to enter the institute. Reina disguises herself as a warlock in a black cloak, and is allowed to walk past the guards. Pearl turns Lelouche invisible and convinces the guard to let her through to talk to Vyner once more. Once in, she also turns herself invisible. Aiwei climbs the roof and enters through an open window in Dr. Anderson’s quarters. They rejoin on the ground floor of the institute, where the invisible Pearl sneaks into the office of Prof. Cotton. There, Vyner is scrying on Dr. Anderson and Dr. Foreman. He explains to his colleagues that the scry on Dr. Anderson was unsuccessful, which means she is either dead or shielded somehow. Dr. Foreman appears to have fled into the forest. Pearl also spots that the cabinet containing the keys into the greenhouse are missing.

Returning, the group sneaks out of the institute once more, and reconvenes by the fractured glass opening of the tropical dome. There they enter the greenhouse for a second time, which is where we finish this week’s session.


### Session 8 – The Lady in the River

The group finds itself in the tropical dome of Greenhouse 3, and make their way to the Nepenthes dome where they had previously fought the Luring Pitcher. The place looks similar, but the remains of the luring pitcher have been removed and heaped together, while the place where the pitcher grew has been tended to, and new pitcher plants have been planted. 

Uneasily, they walk through the central corridor, where they meet four menacing trees bowing across the fountain of youth. “Oh arborious one, could you help us?” Lelouche asks. No reply.  Pearl tries too: “Do you know who I am? We are looking for two scholars.” There is a momentary pause, then a booming voice sounds: “There is only one scholar. He went to the left.”

The group quickly bounds towards the Pottery workshop, where Dr. Foreman suddenly greets them. He tells the group that he fled the institute quickly when he realised that he did not have a good explanation for the carnage in the institute when the warlocks started to investigate the place. He did not see Dr. Jean Anderson, and doesn’t know where she is.

Pearl offers to take him along, as she knows a place to hide. Foreman accepts, but also proudly demonstrates that he has found a way of detecting the mysterious component of Forever. He demonstrates a TLC experiment with a piece of card stock and a droplet of the fluid to be analysed. Holy water, drawn over the card pulls up the component by a certain fraction of the speed of the water front, and after the experiment, one can observe a small silvery spot a certain distance from the original droplet. Foreman admits that he still doesn’t quite know what the component itself is, but at least he can detect it. “Oh and Pearl, will you go out to dinner with me?” he blurts out. Pearl politely declines.

Reina asks if there is a method to detect whether the blood that was found in the pottery workshop is Harba’s. Foreman tells them it is difficult, but with proper comparison, i.e. real blood of Harba, at least he should be able to tell whether the blood is from the same species and if the blood group matches.

The group then decides to take the remaining 11 preserved samples from Dr. Bishop’s lot along. Aiwei also spots a map of the region that details the location of the Marvain Islands, and she takes the map with her as well. Turning Dr. Foreman invisible, they make their way back to the broken glass in the tropical dome (but not before Aiwei tries to fiddle with the ancient Fountain of Youth. She manages to scrape out a clot and cause a minor stream to trickle. Tasting the water, she does not quite vomit, but it is nasty stuff.

After having closed the fractured glass dome with a large piece of wood, the group makes their way to 21 Quay de l’Ombre. Reina plants herself on the comfortable sofa in the parlour as the rest make a little round though the house. Pearl finds the master bedroom with a luxurious bathroom. Realising that there is hot running water, she draws a bath, locks the door to the bathroom and goes for a nice, relaxing soak. Lelouche, meanwhile, finds that there is a cellar underneath the ancient kitchen, with many crates full of fancy bottles of wine. He realises their worth, takes a decent (if not exquisite) bottle upstairs and opens it.

Aiwei, meanwhile, goes to collect some supplies for a meal. On her way, she passes the two urchins she had met earlier that day. They tell her that some university toff met up with a cloaked figure, the day before. They are given an extra silver to keep the surveillance up. On her way back from the markets, she passes by Septimius Alba at ORSA. He tells her that he managed to dig up some files. Apparently a Nathalie Beaumont, young scholar at Waspa’s Institute for Knowledge, was setting up a research line into surgically altering animals into crude humanoid similes. The rulers considered this too dangerous, and she was sentenced to life in prison. Alba didn’t know whether Beaumont was still alive at this time, though, but considers it likely. Upon her return, she tells the others of her finding about Nathalie Beaumont. Dr. Foreman suggests to provide them with a contact they could try at Waspa’s, to see if they can get access to old files there.

A strange vibration runs through the house, followed by a groaning sound, and clanging. It seems to come from the walls. Reina, Pearl and Lelouche hurry down to the cellars to investigate. There, in the dry heat, spiders come swarming from cracks in the walls. Reina and Pearl cut through swathes of spiders, but more keep pouring into the room. Lelouche suddenly remembers that there were no cracks in the walls of the cellar, and that the spiders do not appear to obey gravity. The spiders are illusions. 

While Aiwei sends Loeki, newly in the form of an ant, down one of the pipes in the wall, Lelouche convinces the ladies that there are in fact no spiders. They try to walk up the stairs, only to find that the stairs won’t let them. After trying to run up infinite stairs for a while, Lelouche turns back (he is immediately back in the cellar). He investigates the walls of the cellar, and finds a ridge of paint. With a dagger, he and Reina reveal a door that had been painted over. Heat radiates from the wall, and carefully they open the door. The boiler room is behind this. Underneath one of the boilers, they spot the desiccated body of a humanoid.

Loeki spots this too, alerting Aiwei, and soon the group is complete, standing by the body. While it is hard to discover from the state of the body when this person died, the clothing tell of an upperclass lady living roughly one to two decades ago. Lelouche remembers from the files at the city watch, back when he was still working there, a missing person’s case concerning an Elisabeth Burton. Upon realising this, the ghost possesses Lelouche, overwhelming him with the emotion of sadness and frustration, and the overarching urge to throw the cot in the river and to destroy the paintings.

The group decides to leave the problem of what to do with the corpse for a while, since the house has not seen recent use anyway. They return to the parlour. Lelouche is sad, and turns to heavy drinking. Reina offers her rough moonshine whisky – Lelouche goes Raagh upon drinking it. Crying out loud, he climbs the stairs to the back bedroom, where he spots the cot. Reina follows him, and sees the Tiefling take the cot, push it through the doors to the little balcony and throw it down into the garden. “Are you dying?” she asks him. He shakes his head. Pearl also comes up, takes him in her arms and starts singing a song. This does calm down the man.

Aiwei has come up too, by this point, and suggests knocking some sense into Lelouche. “I think this may not be Lelouche,” she declaims. Lelouche says that of course he is still himself. “These emotions are just too much for you ladies.” “There is only one lady here,” says Pearl, “the others are just women.”

Lelouche bounds up to the attic. There, he starts ripping paintings apart. Aiwei knocks the living daylight out of Lelouche, and he is left stunned, time enough for the others to tie him up. The others, ignoring the sobs of Lelouche, look through the paintings, and see apart from the baby in the cot, the self-portrait, the portrait of the handsome man and the street scapes, a number of paintings of a dark-skinned woman standing in the water. They spot the willow in the garden in one of the paintings, and upon looking closer to the figure, they spot a sort of tattoo or marking on the mysterious woman’s breast – a number of lines, entangled or braided. Pearl gasps: she has a very similar marking herself!

Looking in the frame of the painting that Lelouche attacked, they spot an old journal, a diary of Elisabeth Burton. They read the following passages: 

> Went out for a walk today in the street. The sun was shining, and it was beautiful. When I came back, Florence was crying. Cyrus told me I shouldn’t go out, as I have a very weak constitution. It is not safe for me in the street.

> The Lady in the river talked to me again today. She is very kind, and tells me her name is Rue. Somehow, life doesn’t feel quite so lonely when I talk to her. Cyrus told me that the Lady in the River does not exist, and he’s probably right. Florence cried again. 

> The Lady in the river is back again. I tried to ignore it. I must be going mad. Oh, I wish Florence would stop crying.

Pearl spots the damage on the beams that indicate the former presence of a rope tied to it. Aiwei asks herself and the group aloud whether Elisabeth Burton may have hanged herself. Upon that, the ghost releases Lelouche, and manifests in the form of the pale appearance of Elisabeth Burton. She attacks Lelouche and the others, and while hitting her temporarily causes her to destabilise, she returns ever again. Pearl tries to let a likeness of the woman in the painting appear, and the ghost looks at her expectantly. Aiwei, in the voice she imagines the woman would sound like, tells her “I forgive you.” The ghost relaxes herself, and fades into nothingness. 

Here we conclude the session.

### Session 9 – At the Sign of the Twelfth Column

As Pearl and Lelouche sleep fitfully (and Aiwei, ever her relaxed self sleeps soundly), Reina finds herself staring at a bleak landscape, a coast stretching for miles in either direction, with her standing in the wet sand. Waves wash over her feet as she calls out to anyone present. No reply. She walks for a bit, as she spots a piece of driftwood lying in the shallows. It is black with rot and crusted with barnacles and limpets. Absent-mindedly, Reina pulks at the rotting wood, revealing a layer of paint. Realising this, she cleans away the layer of grime, to reveal the name “Espoir”, a name she recognises as the name of the ship her uncle Murray used to sail with. She hasn’t seen Murray for some 12 years now, though.

Reina wakes in the back bedroom, where Aiwei is meditating. “Do you feel deep regret about something you did?” she asks. Aiwei looks up from the meditative pose. “Not sure. Is there something bothering you?” Reina tells of the dream, and that Murray, her uncle, went away after Reina did something to him that was unforgiving. “I was just thinking, as a monk, you may be able to help with such thoughts.” Aiwei considers this for a moment. “You can always tell such things to me. Erena judges all fairly, and justice will come.” “What would come for me then?” Reina asks. “That depends on what you believe,” Aiwei responds. “Well, I do believe in justice, but I also belief that I wish to be a better person. That is also why I took up the job with the watch.” Aiwei replies: “Well, you don’t strike me as the bad type, anyway.” “Let’s get down. I get all sappy in the morning,” Reina concludes, and the two girls head downstairs.

There they meet with Pearl, her hair immaculate and dressed in a beautiful silk dressing gown. “I didn’t sleep well, so I thought I’d head down and make some tea. Would you all like some?” As Pearl prepares tea for the others, they discuss what to do today. They agree that it would be best for Pearl to talk to either of her parents alone to ask her about the tattoo on her breast. That would allow Reina and Aiwei to visit the police station and check any files on Nathalie Beaumont and Elisabeth Burton. Lelouche comes down, yawning, and apologises for his state. He tells the others to go about their business, and he will stay in bed a bit longer in order to recuperate.

The others leave the brownstone, and almost immediately, Aiwei spots a poster advertising the upcoming opera Telloïdes i Naivazi, starring Giacomo Corpulenti. The opera is due to be performed during the upcoming Orania festivities, at the Twilight Assembly Theatre. The poster shows a young man on a punting skiff surrounded by skull-masks. “Hang on, before we go and check this out, shouldn’t we get properly dressed? We look like shit at the moment,” says Reina. The others mention that, while this is so, the people at the theatre are currently probably only rehearsing, and will not be in fancy dress either. In any case, the theatre has that look of lacking in purpose, since it is between performances.

The group enters the theatre, and is spotted by a halfling girl. She introduces herself as Rosie Swiftwood, a busybody who is eager to please. Of course she can arrange a meeting with the famous and exciting Giacomo Corpulenti. “Well, he does not have time now, as he’s quite busy with rehearsals, but maybe in four weeks?” Aiwei presses on, and eventually the girl concedes that maybe they should talk to her father about this. She takes the group along into the theatre, where carpenters are working on the stage. A sweating, nervous halfling man looks up at the investigators. “Posco Swiftwood. How can I help you? Ooh, I don’t have time for this nonsense.” Swiftwood gets quite defensive when Pearl presses him for an earlier timeframe to meet Corpulenti. In the end he just shuts off the possibility altogether: “Sorry, it can’t be done. I have other business to attend to, goodbye.” Pearl responds: “I have heard all sorts of rumours about this place, most of them not good.” “Vicious lies,” Swiftwood responds. “Well, I wouldn’t want to spread lies,” Pearl continues, “but I see that they may be justified.” 

Swiftwood gives up. “Corpulenti was meant to have shown up days ago for rehearsals. I’ve sunk my entire fortune in this performance, I’m up to here in debts. What can I do?” The group comforts him, and ask him where and when Corpulenti was meant to show up. “I don’t know for sure,” Swiftwood replies, “but the entire affair was arranged by Orist DeVaere, who took care of the travel arrangements.”

Pearl realises that Swiftwood is talking about Eletha’s father. She takes the rest of the group to the DeVaere mansion in Ratwater, while explaining that the DeVaere family trades in favours and debts, and is therefore extremely influential. They are let into the mansion by Ratchett, the ancient butler, who offers to call for Eletha. Pearl quickly steps in and tells him that it’s Orist they want to speak. Ratchett, slightly taken aback, concurs, and tells the group to wait.

They wait for 10-20 minutes until Aiwei has had enough of the waiting. She sneaks out of the parlour to a likely looking door which she suspects may be Orist’s office. Hiding behind a plant, she listens at the door, and sends Loeki, in ant form, inside. There, she sees Orist DeVaere, a handsome, older elf with grey hair at the temples, talk to a hooded figure. “He sticks to his story,” the hooded figure tells him, “but I’m not sure that I trust it.” Orist replies. “Keep a further eye on him. In the near future, it’s probably worth taking the initiative.” The hooded figure nods, then makes his leave. Aiwei darts out of the way to hide behind a vase, but the hooded figure does not spot her. Aiwei follows the hooded figure to the Twelfth Column, the tavern at the Dusk Gate.

Meanwhile, Orist DeVaere enters the parlour. “Ah, miss LeRoux, what a pleasure to see you again,” he starts with his oily voice. Pearl starts telling him that she is a big fan of the opera, and that she would love to arrange a meeting with Giacomo Corpulenti. “Miss LeRoux, you and I both know that you have no interest in the opera, so let’s both stop pretending. You have picked up rumours that Corpulenti is missing. What is your interest in the case?” “It’s professional,” Pearl says. “Remember my detective agency?” “Ah yes, that little boutique detective agency of yours, of course,” Orist replies. “Nothing to worry about, I have my men working on this, and have everything under control. That is my final word on the matter. Oh, Eletha mentioned that she wanted to have a word.” Orist leaves the group.

Soon, the door opens again, and Eletha DeVaere enters. A dark-skinned young elf woman, she greets Pearl with a sly smile. “Are you sleeping well?” Pearl asks her, “you look tired.” “You look spectacular as always,” Eletha replies. “Your eye-shadow is beautifully on point.” Pearl presses the point, and Eletha admits that her father’s been worried about Giacomo Corpulenti. “He arranged it for the wedding, as he wants it to be the most spectacular event. I don’t even like opera, but no, he has to have the world’s most famous tenor performing at my wedding.” “It is rather quick that you decided to get married,” Pearl snips back. Eletha just raises her eyebrows. “Anyway, Corpulenti was meant to be escorted by some of my brother’s friends. I can take you to them,” Eletha offers. The group follows her to the Twelfth Column tavern.

At the Twelfth Column, Eletha introduces the group to Elmar Fadi, the barkeep. He calls up to one of the rooms to collect Jasna Sylhorn, but she does not show up. After Eletha vouches for the group, Elmar tells them of the arrangements they had with Corpulenti. They were supposed to pick him up from his ship on the evening of 11 November. They met him then, where Corpulenti had apparently struck up a friendship with a Dr. Mahendra. Since Dr. Mahendra was looking for a place to stay, Elmar offered him a room at the tavern. Dr. Mahendra accepted, and the four made their way to the tavern. But in the morning, both Dr. Mahendra as well as Giacomo Corpulenti were missing.

Meanwhile, Aiwei has settled down with the hooded figure and pretends to be interested in playing a card game. She is gracious with beer, and the hooded figure is happy to play along for a while. Meanwhile, Aiwei makes sure that the beer keeps on flowing. The hooded figure introduces himself as Brent. Aiwei insinuates that she also works for Orist DeVaere, which eases the conversation between them. She offers help, when he needs it. Brent gladly accepts. He tells Aiwei that Orist thinks that the barkeep is faking his story. He suspects that this Dr. Mahendra figure is a fake, not a real person. Aiwei thanks Brent and tells him that if he needs the help, he should leave a message with Erena’s temple addressed to Erena’s latest initiate. Brent asks conversationally: “I didn’t know that DeVaere was in business with ORSA.” Aiwei nods.

Reina and Pearl are shown the upstairs rooms where Dr. Mahendra and Corpulenti stayed. In Corpulenti’s room they find blood-stained sheets and scratches on the furniture and doorframes. They also find a writing case with a seal and some wax, as well as a letter written in a foreign language (Reina steals this packet, as Pearl keeps Eletha’s attention elsewhere). Finally, Corpulenti left behind a number of suitcases full of costumes (meant for a large man with considerable bulk). In comparison, Dr. Mahendra’s room is clean, with the bed unslept in, and only a small briefcase containing some modest clothes and a pair of round spectacles (no optical strength in them). Soon, Aiwei comes to join them, and she takes some of Corpulenti’s hairs from a brush she finds in one of the cases. 

Elmar Fadi returns, and tells them that Dr. Mahendra went out in the evening to talk to someone at Waspa’s Institute for Knowledge, although he did not see him return that night. Corpulenti himself spent most of the evening eating, and then went to bed late. “What creature could have done this,” he exclaims. The group presses him whether anything strange happened. The barkeep confesses that he did have weird dreams, but that should not matter, right? Aiwei impresses on him that this could be very important. The barkeep then tells them that he had a dream that a tiger entered the tavern, joined with some pigs. He greeted them, and took them up to their rooms (these rooms actually). As he tells the group this, Pearl also detects a faint magical aura around him, suggesting that he may have been under the influence of a powerful spell some time in the past. 

The group then leaves the tavern. Aiwei and Reina make their way to the 11th precinct, as Pearl heads to her parents’ place. Reina greets PC Cosh Arvid who has desk duty. Arvid tells them that the new DI has been annoying the regulars with his different ways. He has taken over the duties of DI Harrelson for now. Arvid also mentions that Hamcrusher would like to speak to Reina soon, but Reina asks him not to mention to Hamcrusher that they were here. They then make their ways to the archives.

In the archives, they find the files on Elisabeth Burton. She was a rich socialite, married to Cyrus Burton, who was reported missing some 17 years ago. Reina gets the impression, reading the file, that the file is deliberately devoid of details, suggesting some money may have passed hands to close the case early. Looking at the details, they find that the SIO on the case was DS Trell Tusker (now a DI). 

They also find the file on Nathalie Beaumont, although most of this file is redacted. They do glean that Beaumont was imprisoned on Skourge Island, a place Aiwei knows as a bleak rock in the Nephra with a heavily fortified building on top. The SIO on the case has been redacted, but they do spot that the most recent person to take the file out of the archives was a Dr. Martinet Stoker, some 6 years ago. Reina and Aiwei take both sets of files out (registering their names in the archives), and then take their leave to meet up with the others at Lady DuBois’ place.

Meanwhile, Pearl heads over to her parents’ place. She finds her mother in the parlour, and asks her about the tattoo or birthmark that she has on her breast. “I have never seen anything like it with anyone else,” Opal says, “although I can’t say I’ve been paying attention. I’ve always thought that you were specially marked, wild, like the river.” She tells Pearl that her older siblings don’t have the mark. “Do you know someone called Rue?” Pearl asks her. “Yes, I do,” her mother replies. “She is one of the people at the embassy to the river goddess. She visits often, and knows you as well. She often has to discuss business with father.” Pearl finds it strange that she cannot remember this lady, if she visits so often. “Maybe you should ask the people at the embassy,” Opal suggests.

Here we close the session. 

### Session 9.5 – What Will the Neighbours Say?

Lelouche, waking up late in the morning and still feeling somewhat mentally battered after yesterday’s events, gets up to get a better look at the paintings himself. Looking closer at the paintings, he notices a small scar on the cheek of Elisabeth Burton. He also reads the passages in the diary that the others have left lying here. 

He heads out into the garden, staring out over the small stream and covered by the large willow tree with its drooping canopy. It really is quite pleasant in the shade of the tree, and Lelouche takes a few moments to sit on the bank of the water. 

Then, he hears some knocking on the door. It’s a runner, who bears a message that a potential client is waiting for Lelouche in an inn close to his own office. He heads over, where he meets a black lady, her veil barely disguising the tattooing in black and green on her face. She wears a silver pendant in the likeness of Imiz and Orana. “My name is Rosalie Beaumont,” she says in a heavy Tressian accent. “Could we speak more privately?”

Lelouche leads her to his office, where she continues. “An abandoned shipwreck has beached itself on the banks of the Necropolis, which is under our care.” She explains that Ordained of Orana have tried to launch the ship again, but found themselves chased away by strange vibrations, pulsations, coming off the ship. She was hoping to employ someone with experience in the supernatural, yet able to stay discrete, in order to find out what is going on with the wreck. “It is not strange for ships to beach themselves anywhere in the Lower Nephra, if they found themselves in the treacherous waters of the Upper Nephra. However, the situation requires discretion, since the Necropolis is sacred and may not be accessed. We can ferry you across to the ship, and provide you with a disguise, but you are not allowed to access the Necropolis itself.” They agree that the price will be a favour, and Rosalie Beaumont suggests to meet on 59 Quay Bryn at 9 pm that evening.

Lelouche lets Rosalie Beaumont out of the office, then proceeds to buy some broadsheets at the newsagents and town criers. Specifically looking for shipping movements, he spots that the stocks of the Upper Nephra Trading Company have been nosediving recently, due to a spate of misfortunes in the recent months. He heads over to their headquarters, where he talks to one of the desk flunkies. He tells the dwarf that he is a reporter, interested in the human story, and the dwarf is quite happy to tell him that, yes, they have been a bit unfortunate recently, although none of the incidents have been particularly noteworthy. Sometimes storms or dangerous currents causes ships to beach. Sometimes, shipments don’t show up at the appropriate times, and due to tricky currents, empty trading vessels are sometimes forced to return empty handed. This is all par for the course and averages out in the long run of course. 

Lelouche then makes a quick detour past Tollens House, where he asks for more information about Elisabeth Burton, such as her maiden name, and likewise for Cyrus Burton. He pays the 15 gold legal fees, and the scribe behind the desk tells him he can pick up the information after one working day.

Finally, Lelouche decides to ask the neighbours about their knowledge of Elisabeth Burton. When he knocks on the door of the house on the left, a valet opens the door who sniffs at the poor state of Lelouche. He lets Lelouche wait for a good ten minutes, before returning with the message that Béatrice Perrin is not available that day. When questioned, he does mention that Mme Perrin has only lived in this house for a handful of years.

On the right hand side, Lelouche has more luck: a middle aged man with white hair and a monocle opens. He’s excited at the prospect of having visitors and lets Lelouche in, while his valet prepares tea. His name is Dr. Martinet Stoker, and he explains that he is a scholar at Waspa’s. There he researches magic, particularly medical magic. They have an easy conversation, while Stoker talks about his neighbours. He mentions that he hardly ever saw Mrs Burton and didn’t know that she painted. Cyrus did come to the house, but nowadays he tends to favour a different pied-a-terre when he is in Magdalen for Magistrate duties (he knows of them, as he is a magistrate himself, he mentions). Lelouche takes his leave, thanking the doctor for his time, then walks towards Lady DuBois’ mansion to meet up with the others.


### Session 10 – A Hermit’s Welcome

The group reconvenes at the doorsteps of Lady Alida DuBois’ manor in Port Royal, and Pearl, who spots Lelouche first, immediately asks him how he’s been. Lelouche tells the rest about his investigations around the house, and then about his meeting with the priestess of Orana who came to visit him earlier that day. She asked him to meet her later that night to solve a problem with a shipwreck that had landed on the shores of the Necropolis, and was emitting strange surges, vibrations. Lelouche proceeds to tell the rest that he did some digging about the ship, and found out that the Upper Nephra Shipping Company was having some trouble recently – all perfectly explainable, yet the company seems to be troubled by many such incidents recently.

Lelouche then mentions that he spoke to the neighbours about Elisabeth Burton. One of them, typical of the rich, left him waiting for ages, then proceeded to decline. “I get so strung up by that behaviour,” Lelouche mentions. “But our neighbour on the other side is a perfect gentleman with rather marvellous waistcoats. He is also a magistrate and knows Burton personally. Now enough about me, how did you fare?”

“Well, we had some interesting moments too,” says Reina. “First of all, we found out who Giacomo Corpulenti is. Some opera singer.” The group brings Lelouche up to scratch. “Now,” Pearl proceeds, “we have an appointment with Lady DuBois. We want to have a list of names who attended the party at her place when the theft occurred earlier. You two,” she says, pointing at Reina and Aiwei, “could pose as my guards. No offence, but your clothes make you look like a wet dog.”

“None taken,” Reina replies. “Lelouche, you mentioned a shipwreck, didn’t you? I had a dream recently. I’m not entirely sure what it means just yet. I’m standing on a beach that goes on forever, and there’s a piece of driftwood that comes from a ship. It’s the ship that my uncle once sailed on. We didn’t exactly part on good terms, and I’m not sure I want to figure out what happens when we do meet again.”

The group discusses their game plan. They agree that Reina and Aiwei should pose as guards. Reina also mentions that they might do some shopping and get some toolkits that may come in handy, such as a disguise kit or a jewellers’ kit. After having all this planned out, Lelouche knocks on the front door.

A butler lets them into a parlour, where they are told to wait for Lady DuBois. When the butler leaves the group alone, Pearl tells Reina sincerely that she shouldn’t steal anything here. Reina looks miffed, but doesn’t respond. Aiwei, soon fed up with waiting for rich people to show up, starts to sneak out into the hallway. “Aiwei, don’t do that,” Pearl says. “Lady DuBois is going to notice you’re missing, and then we’ll all be in trouble.” “She doesn’t care,” says Aiwei, and stalks out of the room. “This is why I’m fed up with talking to the rich,” Lelouche says, and walks up to a stand with a few decanters of brandy.

“Oh, can I have a look at the glasses,” Pearl asks. Lelouche tosses her a glass, which she admires appreciatively, and then tucks it into her handbag. “What!?” Lelouche shouts out. Pearl looks at him innocently and bats her eyelashes. Grudgingly, Lelouche pours himself a drink and sits down.

Meanwhile, Aiwei sneaks out towards the kitchen, where noises are coming from. A kitchen girl suddenly starts walking towards the door, opens it and spots Aiwei at the door. “Yes, can I help you?” Aiwei retakes herself, and starts angrily. “We’ve been waiting for half an hour, and I was getting fed up with waiting. Is this what you call service?” The girl, intimidated by Aiwei’s presence, leads her back to the parlour with promises to better herself. “And while you’re here, get me some tea,” Aiwei continues. Pearl adds: “Could you get my tea in some more of those pretty glasses?”

The poor girl heads off towards the kitchen, and soon the investigators hear sounds from the servants’ quarters, people arguing. Within a few minutes, footsteps come down from the stairs and Lady Alida DuBois enters the parlour. She is an older dark-skinned lady who talks in a heavy Tressian accent, dressed in silk fineries. “We have some questions concerning the theft of your jewel,” Pearl starts. Lady DuBois kindly tells them that there were no traces found by the staff. The jewel, the Star of the East, was placed after the party in the safe, to which only she and her butler Georges know the code. The jewel is a clear white diamond, set in a mithril pendant. It has been in the family for at least since the Fall of Tresse. Aiwei mentions that there is a familiarity of the name, the Eastern Star and the Star of the West, and wonder whether the two pieces are related. “The Eastern Star is the older jewel. The Star of the West was found later, and named thus for its similarity to the Eastern Star, although it was found west of Magdalen.” Aiwei asks the lady if she has a painting of the jewel. Lady DuBois responds that she does have one, and will ask Georges to pack it for them. Upon asking, she also has Georges prepare a list of guests who were present at the party on the night of the 12th of November. 

Upon looking at the list of names, Pearl spots the name of Lady Rue. “Why was she here?” she exclaims. “She is quite the socialite,” Lady DuBois responds. “She knows my mother, doesn’t she?” Pearl asks. “Yes,” is the answer, “although I associate her more with your father.” “Why wasn’t I invited?” Pearl presses. “You were, actually,” Lady DuBois bites back.

Lady DuBois proceeds to tell that when she went for bed, a few of the younger guests were still there, together with her daughter Elodie. “Perhaps you can ask her yourself. She is not here at the moment, but you will have the chance to speak to her when we travel to Marborough together, as I understand.” The conversation is over. Aiwei asks if she can talk to the butler Georges, and Lady DuBois allows it.

Georges takes the investigators to the safe. Reina gives it the once-over and decides that she could probably pick the lock. While she starts picking the lock, Aiwei questions Georges on whether he had mysterious dreams recently. Georges responds in the negative. Without too much hassle, Reina is able to open the lock within a few minutes. The safe is empty, but Reina spots a few minute marks on the tumblers that suggest the lock has been picked before.

With that, the group leaves the manor. Reina announces that she would like to ask around on the Black Markets, but Lelouche mentions that they are soon expected for their job with the priestess. “Oh, didn’t I mention that you were invited too?” Lelouche proceeds to tell about the job offered by the priestess of Orana. Since it is on the shores of the Necropolis, discretion is required. However, the priestess offered to be of service at a later date. “In any case I’ve always wanted to see the Necropolis, although preferably not in a box.”

The group heads to the Bryn Quay in lower Columnborough, where they are greeted by the priestess, accompanied by two Ordained. The priestess introduces herself as Rosalie Beaumont, and tells the investigators to change into the outfits of the Ordained. Aiwei realises that Rosalie Beaumont may be family of Nathalie Beaumont, the woman who was imprisoned for surgically altering animals years ago. She asks her about this, and Rosalie mentions that Nathalie is her grandmother from her father’s side. She has never met Nathalie Beaumont, though. 

The skiff, punted by the two Ordained, presses through the fog, following light and sound signals, until a massive shipwreck arises from the fog. Aiwei, with her trained nautical eye, spots the remains of a rotted flag, and the name “Silver Heron”. The ship is a typical shallow-bottomed vessel to transport silk along the treacherous upper Nephra to the Tane and to Magdalen. They ascend the ship and search the deck. Aiwei walks into the captain’s quarters – a whole mess of junk lies here. Rummaging through the fractured furniture and barrels, a snapping hermit crab starts to attack Aiwei. The others rush to her aid, as a second hermit crab starts snapping, and expelling blasts of brackish water filled with fishing tackle and hooks. One hermit crab is quickly dispatched off under the barrage of Aiwei’s fists, but the other, more cleverly, uses the makeshift crate as a shell and is able to get away onto the deck, where Pearl’s stinking cloud spell arrests it. 

The captain’s quarters cleared out, they find a small bag of rubies and a scale model of the ship in a bottle, hidden away in a small chest underneath a floorboard. They then head down into what is the ship’s galley. Looking around, the galley too is full of of smashed furniture. Some movement is visible. Aiwei takes a few steps to investigate, and spots three, no, four, five more hermit crabs scuttle into vision.

And that is where we finish the session.

### Session 11 – Seafood
Surrounded by hermit crabs of different sizes and shapes, occupying old crates and vats, the group springs to attention. Pearl immediately releases a stunning cloud into the space in the back, immobilising two of the larger, threatening hermit crabs, and Aiwei jumps down to the smaller ones that have appeared behind the group. The one larger hermit crab that is free immediately blasts a jet of briny water with fishing tackle and metal hooks to Pearl and Lelouche. Both get stuck in the tangle of wire, immobilising them. 

Reina and Lelouche both attempt to get closer to the hermit crabs, but also suffer massive hits as the hermit crabs strike back. Aiwei nearly gets surrounded by the smaller hermit crabs, and one of them deals critical damage to the otherwise agile monk. Lelouche and Aiwei are in a bad position, especially when one of the larger hermit crabs bounds into Lelouche, knocking him over to the side of the ship. Pearl manages to bring Aiwei up to health somewhat, allowing the monk to pound the smaller hermit crabs both to a pulp. Pearl then proceeds to heat the metal inside the barrels that the larger hermit crabs have taken up as their residence. The scent of fried prawn starts to emanate from the creatures, struggling to get themselves out of their shells, leaving a sickly white soft body open to the air. 

Aiwei realises she smells a different scent – cinnamon, clove and ginger, and some more spices. It is not an unpleasant scent, and it is urging her to close her eyes. She takes the plunge, closes her eyes, and notices that she can feel the presence of all living creatures around her. Apart from the larger hermit crabs in the galley, five more smaller ones are hiding in the rubble close to Lelouche. But that is not all: there is another presence, far larger, further down. Keeping her eyes closed, she jumps towards the five hidden hermit crabs and starts pounding them to mush. Two immediately are felled, the others severely injured.

By this time, the group experienced the ship shuddering and tilting, and slowly, water is seeping into one side of the ship. Feeling that they do not have much more time, Pearl calls out to the others, allowing them to flee. Lelouche and Reina untangle themselves from their fight with the remaining hermit crabs and start to flee back into the galley. The hermit crabs don’t follow. Aiwei, meanwhile, darts into the front corridor. 

Looking through the different rooms towards the front of the ship, she finds mostly crew quarters, but a trapdoor in the floor, normally allowing access to the cargo hold, is blocked by something white and slimy, and quite tough. Aiwei signs to the others to meet her above decks. She takes the front staircase and emerges into the Navigator’s Quarters. Here, she finds a folder of sodden, wet maps, and the navigator’s log. All reconvene on deck.

It is still dark, and foggy, but nevertheless, the group immediately spots that they are on open water. The ship appears to be moving backwards, at quite a speed, given the wake that the shipwreck leaves behind. Aiwei, with her experience of ships, knows that something is amiss here. Either the ship is being dragged, or something is carrying it. 

“I knew it,” Lelouche exclaims. “I knew we shouldn’t have come here. We’re stuck on this ship now!” Aiwei discusses the idea that something below the water may be dragging the ship. “Do we have any rope?“ she asks. Lelouche has a standard length of rope, which Aiwei ties to her middle, then she dives into the icy waters of the Nephra. Swimming against the wake, she reaches the front and dives below, where she sees what has been propelling the ship all along: a gargantuan hermit crab, similar in appearance to the smaller ones the group spotted on board of the wreck. This massive crab appears to have made the entire ship its shell. 

She climbs back up and reports her findings. The group freaks out. There is no land in sight – the presence of Magdalen can sort of be deduced by the slightly lighter skies to the right of where the ship is cruising now. The group discuss possibilities and quickly come to the conclusion that swimming to shore is not going to work. Then Pearl mentions that she could cast Tongues on herself and talk to the creature.

She ties the rope to her own waist, and Lelouche offers to hold the rope for her. “You better keep a good hold on it,” Pearl nods to him. “I wouldn’t like to get my hair wet.” She graciously dives into the freezing, inky black Nephra and takes position close to the front of the ship. Looking under the water, she sees the creature, and proceeds to cast Tongues on herself. 

“Hello hermit crab,” she starts. “Could you help us? We got onto your back by accident. Could you get us home?” “Are you food?” the hermit crab asks her in return, in a deep bubbling voice. “No, we were here by accident.” “Are you a mate?” “Yes, I’m very friendly,” Pearl replies, misunderstanding the creature’s intent. “You’re tiny. Would give me tiny offspring,” the creature complains. “No, I want to go home!” Pearl tries. “What would you like?” The creature considers this, and replies “I want food.” Pearl tells the creature that if he brings them home, there will be much food for it. The creature seems to agree. “Home.” Pearl allows herself to be dragged up to the deck again. The course of the creature has shifted, although Aiwei spots that the ship is not moving in the direction of Magdalen.

Pearl climbs back down again, having warmed up somewhat, and continues. “No, our home! You see the lights? Go to the lights. There is food there!” She manages to be very convincing, and the gargantuan Hermit Crab starts to change its course once more. Now the ship is heading for Magdalen at speed. 

Pearl quickly allows herself to be dragged up again, so that she can warm up before the effects of hypothermia set in. The ship cruises along at speed for some fifteen minutes, and slowly, the shapes of the city start to appear through the fog. 

“Eh, ladies,” Lelouche starts, “not to be complaining or anything, but don’t you think that having this giant monstrous crab in the city is maybe not such a great idea? Can we prevent it from destroying the harbour?” “Maybe we can make a raft,” Aiwei suggests. From old wood, the group pulls together a makeshift raft and let it to water. Pearl meanwhile sets up small light orbs to distract the creature. The creature, aiming for the lights, needs to make a few sharp turns. She then projects the images of a few dead bodies in the water. The creature attempts to eat it, without success. Frustrated, the creature dives into the deep, taking most of the ship with it. Only the rising bubbles show any sign of the ship being there, and soon even those vanish.

The group paddles to the harbour on their makeshift raft. Reaching the quay, they climb, sodden, onto dry land. The raft falls apart from abuse, and the group takes a brisk pace to 21 Quay de l’Ombre, where they set up a roaring fire, get into dry clothes and open up some wine from the cellars. Aiwei wakes Dr. Foreman, so she can give him some of the blood samples she took from the greenhouse, then proceeds to follow the ritual that allows her to change her familiar back into its cat shape. 

Dr. Foreman is very glad to see Pearl again, and allows Lelouche to persuade him to give Pearl a foot massage. One by one, the members of the group tuck in for bed, and we close the session.

### Session 12 – Barn Owls

It is the morning of 18 November, and soon the carriages leave for Marborough from Granville Rowle’s offices. Aiwei, reading through the recovered navigator’s logs from the Silver Heron, finds the final three entries that tell of the ship’s woes – although no explicit mention of the event that caused the ship to wreck is found within. Lelouche joins her, and the two talk through what it means. “I really am not sure how all of this is relevant,” Aiwei asks herself. “The ship is likely a silk barge, and this matches with what I know of Brassmere.” Lelouche confirms this. From his research, he knows that Brassmere is a 20-30 year old trading outpost of the Upper Nephra Shipping Company, which has had such bad luck recently. He also found out that Cyrus Burton is the director of the Upper Nephra Shipping Company. “But it really begs the question, what has happened between this final log entry and the moment the wreck was discovered by the Ordained,” he says. The two speculate whether the hermit crabs were recent incursions in a wreck that has been floating for months. “The crabs caused the surges, right? We didn’t find any bodies on board?” Aiwei asks, and Lelouche confirms.

Reina has joined the two. “So, about the blood samples that Dr. Foreman analysed for us?” she asks. Aiwei shows the results: the vial from the Twelfth Column Inn contained pig blood, with a minute quantity of Forever inside, as well as a massive amount of Slice. A vial containing a very similar mixture was recovered from the greenhouse. Finally, a vial of Halfling blood, also containing a small amount of Forever, was found in the greenhouse too. “The Halfling was probably Harba,” Aiwei says. “I suspect that the boar people were probably not born as boar people,” Reina adds. “Yes, although the boar people themselves said that Hamm created them.”

“Maybe we should ask that scientist woman,” Lelouche brings up. “She’s in jail,” Reina says, “but maybe we can arrange a visit. Maybe we can ask Hamcrusher. It’s funny that his name is Hamcrusher. Would he be the one to ‘crush the ham’?” They all laugh. “We can ask the last person who took out the file on Nathalie Beaumont,” says Aiwei. “His name is Dr. Martinet Stoker.” 

Lelouche drops his spoon, and his mouth falls open. “He’s our neighbour! I’ve talked to him only days ago. We should go and speak to him!” Aiwei responds: “How are we going to approach him?” “Well,” Lelouche says, “he struck me as a man better to trap with honey than with vinegar. And if that doesn’t work there is always the metaphorical stick.” “Which is an actual stick,” Aiwei quips.

Lelouche knocks on their neighbour’s door, and soon Dr. Martinet Stoker answers. Genial as ever, he introduces himself to the other new neighbours, but apologises that he has an appointment at Waspa’s soon. “If we could step in for just a moment,” Lelouch offers, but Dr. Stoker replies: “Maybe you can walk with me towards Waspa’s.” He puts on his travelling cloak and locks him door behind him. “You see,” Lelouche starts, “we’ve been involved in a case, and came across a certain individual called Nathalie Beaumont. Have you ever hear of her?” Dr. Stoker thinks for a while. “Yes, I did come across her name. Mind you, it was a couple of years back. I remember reading something about the poor woman and all that nasty business.” “What did you read?” Lelouche prompts. “The poor woman was tried for treason, very likely because she was researching something that the leaders of the city didn’t like, back then. This was several decades ago.”

“Why did you find out about this case, if it was this long ago?” Aiwei asks. “Because of missing lab journals,” Dr. Stoker responds. “I was going through the archives and found a significant gap that corresponded to Beaumont’s period at Waspa’s. Now this sometimes happens, students take lab journals home when they’re not supposed to, but it was so thorough that I got somewhat suspicious. I know she was a surgeon, but there is simply no information available about her work in our archives, which is curious for someone who used to be a research fellow here. I have to admit that I sort of abused my position as Magistrate to pull some records from the city watch, but they were not exactly clear either. The most I figured out was that Beaumont found some knowledge from an indigenous tribe in the Naivazi, and was hoping to extend the knowledge on this ritual.”

“Were there any research students?” Aiwei asks. “Curiously enough, I never considered that,” Dr. Stoker replies. “She must have had some. I’ll have a look through the archives to see if I can find traces of that.” “Maybe we can assist when looking through the archives,” Reina offers. Dr. Stoker considers this. “Yes, this may be a good idea. I unfortunately don’t have time today, so you’ll have to ask me later. I’m afraid I cannot give you access without a supervisor, we value our secrets.” “We do know Phineas Vyner, who may be willing to supervise us when you don’t have time today,” Aiwei offers up. “Ha, well he would like a look through our archives himself. He’s a warlock from the Black Academy. We work together quite amicably, of course, but we do keep our little secrets.” He thinks a little more, then looks at the investigators mischievously. “I say, maybe you can do me a favour. Can you figure out what our good friend Phyneas Vyner knows about a little theory called Aura Vitalis? It translates roughly as Breath of Life. I know they are working on the topic, but he doesn’t want to divulge how much he knows already. In exchange I can probably get you access to the archives, or something similar.” With that, he says his goodbyes, walks up to the solid brick wall of the tower of Waspa’s, places his hand on a brick and vanishes.

There is not a lot of time before the coach for Marborough is meant to depart. The group makes its way to the offices of Batchelor, Bellefontaine and Rowle Solicitors, where a full-sized stagecoach awaits them. Footmen assist the wheelchair bound Granville Rowle into the coach, as the solicitor complains loudly about the proceedings. “Steady on,” he exclaims. Aiwei notices two bottles of very good brandy in his bag full of legal proceedings, and alerts Reina to it. Reina sneaks in, as the solicitor is carried and strapped into the coach. She takes out one of the two bottles, pours out the contents into a flask of her own, and refits it with water and food colouring. She also uses the prestidigitation cantrip to flavour the water into that of fine brandy. Aiwei causes a distraction by gently knocking into the hollow of the knee of one of the footmen. Under the weight of the solicitor and the wheelchair, he collapses and Lelouche needs to come and assist to get the poor man strapped into the coach. However, the bottle is placed back. 

With everybody in the coach, it departs, only to stop a few streets later, where Lady Alida DuBois and her daughter Elodie board. The greeting is quite cold, although Elodie looks curiously at Lelouche in particular. Aiwei suspects she is seeing Lelouche’s brother, hence the somewhat awkward familiarity that is visible in her gaze. 

The coach leaves the Magdalen through the Meadow Gate and drives into the hinterland. Soon, after passing the zoological gardens, the coach drives into a gully covered in tree ferns. Suddenly the coach makes a strong tug to the left, and the whole coach comes crashing down into the ditch next to the road. The horses are spooked, two of them running off into the distance, and the axle of the coach is broken. Granville Rowle complains loudly, as the others dismount and look around carefully, suspecting a possible ambush from robbers. Nothing comes. The coachmen tell the group that the horses got spooked by a couple of flying monkeys. The monkeys themselves are sitting in the tree, curiously watching the proceedings. “Do you get flying monkeys often?” Aiwei asks the coachman. “No, I’ve never seen them here.” Aiwei knows that monkeys are not native to these parts, although she herself never saw flying monkeys. The coachmen say that the fastest for them to proceed is for one of them to drive back into town and arrange a substitute coach, since the repairs on this coach would take too long. He soon departs.

With the help of Loeki, Aiwei and Reina try to capture one of the monkeys, who has landed on Lelouche’s head. Reina creates a trick banana that she throws on the floor, and all monkeys dive onto it. Loeki pounches, spreading the monkeys wide, and Aiwei misses it completely. One of the monkeys lands on her head. She jumps herself and manages to capture one. It struggles mightily, then it gives up, and sadly awaits its fate. Aiwei stuffs it into a bag. The other two monkeys follow at a safe distance, anxious for their friend.

Loeki watches around, and notices an animal smell from back up the road. Stealthily backing up, Loeki follows the trail, with Aiwei looking on, and soon the familiar finds itself on the grounds of the Magdalen Zoological Gardens. Multiple animals appear to have escaped there, from the commotion of the keepers. The group approaches and talk to the director, Dr. Gilbert Hogwood. He is distraught, but the investigators offer to assist.

“That would be most welcome,” dr. Hogwood starts. “We’ve located a couple of the creatures, but the Chameleon Tiger is still missing, and we think we know where the owl bears are, but we cannot get them back into their cages.” “Can you show us the Chameleon Tiger enclosure?” Aiwei asks. Dr. Hogwood leads the investigators to two cages, one obviously in disuse for years. “Poor Roji. She lost her mate Yana four years ago, when he went missing. We never found him. Magnificent creatures, really, and they can fend well for themselves, but a city is no place for a Chameleon Tiger.” The investigators manage to hide their surprise at hearing the name Yana. Looking around the enclosure, they find traces of a forced lock and the prints of pig trotters, consistent with prints they found earlier. Sotto voce, Aiwei tells the others “I suspect that we killed the male tiger a few days ago.”

The group is then lead to the cages where the owl bears are kept. Here, the door of the cages has been ripped with massive force outward, and large prints can be seen leading to a nearby barn. “It’s a mating pair, and the female has been on the verge of laying eggs. We take good care of them,” dr. Hogwood tells the group. Aiwei, looking at the size of the cages, doubts this. There is a strong animal scent coming from the barn, and sounds of large animals can be heard inside.

Reina sends her familiar Oatmeal inside. He flies around the barn and spots the two owl bears, suspicious but not aggressive, as they guard a clutch of eggs. As the familiar owl returns (the owl bears recognise it as kin), the group talks through what to do with the owl bears. So far, they appear to be fine where they are, and in a better spot than the cages. The barn is about six times the size of the official enclosure, after all. Lelouche offers up the idea to reinforce the barn, so that the owl bears can make it their home, but don’t go outside of the enclosure. “Maybe you can mould earth around the barn?” he suggests. The idea takes hold, and while Reina and Lelouche go back to the Chameleon Tiger enclosure to search for more clues, Aiwei starts shaping the earth. The keepers are hesitant at first, not realising what she does, but when it becomes clear, they start to offer up their own ideas, happy about the turn of events. A ring of earthen wall is made around the barn, with a viewing platform and feeding trough. 


### Session 13 – Dead Man's Party

Arriving at Alderley, the ancestral seat of the Burton family in Marborough, the group is welcomed by the butler, while footmen assist in removing the luggage and the wheelchair-bound Rowle from the coach. There is light rain, but nothing to bad yet. Excitedly, Reina helps along with dragging luggage inside as the others stretch out their legs after a few hours of travel. “Can we talk to mr Burton before the party gets started,” Lelouche asks a footman. The footman offers to ask Burton, but invites the group to refresh and make themselves comfortable in their rooms before. 

“Pearl, do you need any help with your personal preparations?” Reina asks. “I do my own make up,” Pearl replies “but are you alright yourself?” Reina hesitates for a moment, then goes “Oh yes, sure!” “So, what do we know of the whole setup here?” Lelouche asks. “Well, we don’t know where the jewel is now,” says Reina. “Likely it is best to keep our eyes on Florence all night,” Pearl replies. “Maybe we can put some seals and wires in doorways to keep track of movement,” Reina offers.

The group is lead to their rooms, most on the upper floors except for Lelouche, who has been given a room on the ground floor of the East Wing. Reina dresses quickly in her elegant black dresses provided by Pearl’s maids, then lingers on the landing of the central hall to observe people. She spots a young priest in a black cassock pass through the hall, although he barely acknowledges her presence. Soon she is joined by Lelouche, in a plum-coloured jacquet. “I just saw that priest of Vitrion pass,” Reina mentions. “Very young chap. Hey, do you know anything about Vitrion yourself, Lelouche?” Lelouche thinks for a while before responding. “He’s the god of nature, isn’t he? Jackal-headed chap? I believe he’s sometimes called the Wounded Jackal. A free spirit, never cruel nor cowardly.”

Pearl dresses herself in the champaign-coloured evening dress that has been prepared for her, with a deep cut low back, and takes the time to put all her glorious tresses of auburn hair up. She then proceeds to Florence’s room, knocks on the door and is admitted by Florence Burton. Florence is quite a tall young woman, athletic, with quite muscular upper arms. “I was wondering if you needed any help to prepare,” says Pearl. “Do you know who I am?” “Yes,” Florence replies, “you are mms LeRoux and you are here to take care of me tonight.” “That’s right.” “Well, I don’t need so much help.” Pearl is slightly taken aback, but recovers almost immediately. On a bust on the vanity is the tiara, with a large diamond set in the middle. “Bit gaudy, isn’t it?” Florence says, spotting Pearl gazing at the jewel. “Papa wished for me to wear it. But I would just as rather just sell the damn thing and be done with it.”

Aiwei has just joined the group, dressed in a tight waistcoat and shirtsleeves, when Pearl approaches the landing, stepping elegantly in the beams of light shining into the hallway with a flourish. “Do you like the gowns?” Pearl asks. Reina nods. “Pearl, you’re very pretty, why aren’t you married off yet?” Pearl is taken aback for a moment. “Oh, eh, I wouldn’t want to lose my freedom,” she replies.

“Strategy time,” Lelouche announces. “We should ask Florence not to take off the tiara. Also, we should consider using codenames. After the incident with the imposter, anyone could impersonate us. You are all very good with magic, what’s to say that others are not?“ Reina suggests to use set questions and unlikely answers. “So, for me the question could be ‘Do you know who I am?’” Pearl suggests. “No,” Reina says, “that’s too obviously you. Better would be ‘What time is it?’ Whereupon I reply ‘bacon’.” Lelouche settles on the question “How did you and Aiwei meet?” “She beat three guys to a pulp.” Aiwei goes for “Who is dearest to you in the whole world?” “My sister Maiko”, Reina goes for “Can I get you anything to drink?“ “No but I will have two bites of salted pork please,” while Pearl goes for “Do you know who you are?” “Smelly cat.”

Armed with this preparation, the group is lead to Cyrus Burton’s study. Cyrus Burton is a fat dandy, dressed in white suits, with a large grey walrus moustache adorning his face. “Ah yes, mms LeRoux and associates. Please come in,” he starts. “Where is the, eh, candy?” Lelouche asks. “In her room,” Burton replies. Aiwei asks some questions about the tiara, where it usually is. “We usually keep it in the safe here,” Burton replies, gesturing to a large metal strongbox, “and that is where we will place it after the night is done. In any case, I’ve hired some extra staff, four footmen will patrol the grounds and keep an eye on any intruders. And then there’s you four who provide extra security. If you will excuse me, I need to have a word with my solicitor before the soirée gets started. Make yourself at home in the drawing room, where the others are.” Burton potters off towards the East Wing, where Granville Rowle has his room. Reina looks at the safe, a seemingly unremarkable thing, and marks the position of the dial, then the group leaves the study.

Aiwei sends Loeki to follow Burton, and Loeki spots the man knocking on Rowle’s door. Rowle follows Burton back to his study, where Burton closes the door before Loeki can get in. Soon, Loeki hears the sound of clinking glass as the two men start on their brandies. Meanwhile, the group discusses what to do. “We should go up to Florence’s room, have a little poke around,“ Lelouche says. “Not like that,” he adds, seeing the looks on Pearl’s face, while his own face quickly reddens. “Florence is very careless with the thing,” Reina says, “there could be some insurance thing going on.“ “But this is supposed to be a burglar of some renown,” says Aiwei. “Still, Burton may use the Ghost’s MO to make the scam believable,” Lelouche adds. 

The group goes up to Florence’s room, where Pearl introduces the rest of the group to Florence. Reina takes a quick glance at the tiara, and mentions to the others that it’s likely the real thing, or possibly a very good fake. The group discusses a code phrase with Florence, “Is there anything you need?” “I could go for a swim”. Lelouche locks the windows, while Reina leaves some small leaves behind to seal the doors and windows.

The group then proceeds to the drawing room, leaving Florene in her room. They are joined by Lady Alida and her daughter, who have changed from their traveling clothes into fashionable silks. In the drawing room, a couple of people are already there. Lelouche immediately spots Feely Wickham, who hastes away from her conversation with the young priest of Vitrion. Lelouche also spots another grey-skinned Tiefling. His brother, Barthélémy looks up, completely ignores Lelouche and clasps Elodie’s hands in his, and they start happily chatting in a corner of the room. Lady DuBois sr. looks somewhat lost, as the only older person in the room currently. “Thank you for rescuing me from Quincy Stuart-Lane,” Feely tells Lelouche. “He really is the most terrible bore. I couldn’t find a good excuse to extract myself from the conversation. Now why haven’t you still visited our place yet?” she exclaims with a mocking glance.

Aiwei joins the young priest, Quincy Stuart-Lane. Soon their talk turns to Waspa’s Institute of Knowledge, the neighbours of the Wooden Cathedral. “Well of course there is a lot of crosstalk,” Stuart-Lane mentions. “Our institutes are quite close together, and sometimes our clergymen give lectures there and vice versa. The grandmaster of the institute makes a sizeable donation to our church. Of course, we have the necessary academic disagreement, but it’s all very amicable.”

Aiwei excuses herself and sneaks off towards the servants’ quarters. Listening at the door, she hears the butler shouting out orders to a stressed-out staff. She announces herself, and the butler acknowledges her presence. He soon joins her, and the two step aside for a moment. “I understand that you have been hired to provide additional security for tonights’ events?” the butler asks. “Correct. I would like to talk through the security arrangements here,” Aiwei replies. “Ah yes,” the butler continues. “We have twelve footmen who are regular hands, and for tonight we have hired an additional four, known to us and trusted. They have worked for us before. Those four have been stationed outside and patrol the grounds. There are two entrances, the main entrance and the staff entrance by the kitchen. Both entrances always have a detail of two footmen. The others patrol the house while also performing serving duties.” Aiwei asks who the newest member of staff is. “That would be Frederic, he has joined us some three months ago,” the butler responds. 

Aiwei returns to the party while Pearl approaches Elodie and Barthélémy. Elodie looks up from Barthélémy who was in the process of citing poetry at her, to introduce Pearl to him. “This is Pearl LeRoux,” she mentions, upon which Barthélémy looks at Pearl with wide open eyes. “Eh, you are Pearl LeRoux?!” he exclaims, stumbling over his words and unable to look away from Pearl. Pearl is offended and returns quickly to Lelouche. “You won’t believe what just happened,” she whispers to him, and mentions the incident. “You don’t say,” Lelouche says. “Were they on edge?” “Yes, I thought so!” Pearl replies. “We should keep an eye on him,” Lelouche whispers back. “But, in your professional capacity of a lady, don’t you think this is just the behaviour of a young man in the presence of a beautiful lady?“

By that time, Feely Wickham joins Lelouche and Pearl. With a wicked smile, she approaches Pearl. “I’ve heard a rumour about you, Pearl,” she says. “Apparently someone has been spreading some talk that you’ve spent a night working at Dreams of Satin, that old brothel in Duskgate.” “That is ridiculous!” Pearl exclaims. “Yes, you don’t need to work at all,” Lelouche adds. “You are already loaded.” “Well, I know that,“ Feely responds, “but someone has been spreading this hot gossip. I’ll ask around to see who it is.” “Who originally told it to you?“ Pearl asks. “The vicar,” says Feely.

As canapées are served, Cyrus Burton enters and announces his daughter. Florence enters, in a long silk gown and wearing the mithril tiara with the Star of the West set in it. After the spectacular entrance, she joins Quincy Stuart-Lane and Feely Wickham, and is quickly joined by the group.

By now, the rain outside has picked up significantly, and can be heard pounding against the glass windowpanes. Soon, the final two guests of the evening join the drawing room. Commander Franklin Clint, a firm athletic man dressed in the military uniform and golden regalia of the Golden Brand, the standing army, joins first. He looks tired and somewhat stressed, but upon arriving he joins Cyrus Burton and the two withdraw somewhat. Meanwhile, Jacques Robichaud, a handsome young bachelor, also enters.

Aiwei approaches Burton and Clint, and listens to their conversation. She picks up some snippets.

> Clint: “Courbier has overstepped her mark. She must realise that what she is doing is going to lead to her downfall.”

> Burton: “Her supporters are a fierce bunch. I will support you if you decide to wipe it all clean.” 

> Clint: “Your support is noted”

Armed with this information, she rejoins the others and relays this. Pearl knows that Valérie Courbier is the spiritual leader of the church of Vadohr, the tiefling god.

Pearl approaches Quincy Stuart-Lane, who had been talking to Jacques Robichaud. “I have heard that you have been telling some stories about me,” Pearl starts. Stuart-Lane pales somewhat. “Mms LeRoux, I heard some talk, yes. You know, if you need a a place to get things off your chest, I am bound to the sanctity of confession. Vitrion always has a place for those who truly repent.” “There is nothing I need to get off my chest! And you shouldn’t spread malicious lies about people!” Pearl truly butchers the poor vicar, leaving Jacques Robichaud laughing heartedly at her treatment of the clergyman. 

The group spends some time collecting gossip. Florence tells Lelouche that his brother has been seeing Elodie for a couple of months now – the two are sitting in a corner of the room, with no attention but for each other – but that they’ve been having a good time. She also mentions Robichaud, a young entitled bachelor with political ideas she doesn’t agree with. Then a gong sounds, and the whole party is lead into the dining room for dinner.

Dinner is a somewhat dull affair after all the gossip of before. Five courses pass, with only Quincy Stuart-Lane leaving the room once, quickly, to pick up a book from his room. After dinner, Cyrus Burton invites the men to join him in the Library for cigars and brandy, while the women are invited to join Florence in the conservatory. The group is somewhat annoyed at the forced sexism of it all (what year is it? 150?!), and Aiwei decides to join the men. “Granville, old chap, can I pester you for a moment? Need to speak to you privately in my offices. I’ll roll you there,” Burton announces. “Will join the rest of you soon.”

Meanwhile, Reina goes on to investigate Florence’s room. Apart from a broken seal on the front door, the room is untouched. She does spot the draft of a letter, addressed to Quincy Stuart-Lane, in which Florence announces her intention to make a substantial donation to the church of Vitrion. She quickly joins the others downstairs again. Aiwei follows Burton and Rowle to the study. There she once again hears the clinking of brandy glasses, and hears the two talk some business. Soon after, the two break up, and Granville heads to bed. Aiwei sends Loeki to follow Rowle, and Loeki manages to sneak into his rooms before the door is closed. As Rowle heads to bed, Loeki goes through Rowle’s papers until the cat finds something interesting. Speculating about taking the papers outside, Aiwei quickly decides against it, since the rain has picked up even more. Instead, Loeki pushes the papers underneath the doorframe, where Aiwei can read them. It is a legal document detailing a trust, left by Elisabeth Burton to her daughter, which is to pass to Florence upon her 18th birthday. 

Aiwei joins the party again. Meanwhile, Lady Alida DuBois has become extremely tipsy, and fawns over Florence that she should take care of that jewel of hers. After all, a thief can just come and take it away. Uncomfortably in the presence of this drunken aristocrat, the ladies rejoin the men in the library. But it is quickly clear that the party is nearing its end. Quincy Stuart-Lane retires for bed, and is soon followed by Commander Clint. Elodie and Barthélémy follow soon after, and one by one the people leave the library. Jacques Robichaud leads Florence back to the conservatory, but their conversation is somewhat stifled by the presence of the four investigators, and Robichaud also heads off. Florence looks at the four. “Well, would you like to join me in your bedroom?” she asks. “Come on, it’s not necessary. Here, take this, if you feel that you need to. I’m off to bed.” She rips the tiara of her head and storms off. 

With the tiara in hand, Reina takes more time to look at the diamond. And something about it is annoying her. And after moving it in different light for some time, she realises that the reflection is off. This is not a real diamond. It is a fake! However, it has been a fake for quite some time, the setting has aged somewhat, and Reina estimates that the fake stone has been in place for at least a year. The group decides to confront Burton with this. They knock on his study, and bedroom door, but he is not there. They look around until they return to the library, where they spot Burton, sagged in a chair, face white as a sheet, and a dagger plunged in his chest.
